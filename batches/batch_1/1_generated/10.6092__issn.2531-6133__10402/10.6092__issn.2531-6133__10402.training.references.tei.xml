	<bibl><title level="a">54 McKnight concurs in Hart&apos;s view of Blackstone&apos;s treatment of the law of nature and sees it as making way for Blackstone&apos;s focus on indifferent matters. See McKnight, supra note 2, at 405. McKnight&apos;s understanding also supports, if ironically, the argument that Blackstone thereby paves the way for his own brand of natural law analysis. See infra notes 309-12 and accompanying text. Two other criticisms of the Commentaries deserve scant mention here. First, the radical critique of Duncan Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, 28 BUFF. L.

            <table>concerns itself with matters indifferent. Whereas Aquinas casts human<lb/> law essentially in the position of providing determinations that apply<lb/> rules of the natural law in particular contexts, 43 Blackstone sees human<lb/> law having greatest play where the law of nature appears mute. This<lb/> significant role in his analysis for things indifferent owes a major debt to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican point of view. 44<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s introductory remarks on law and their relation to the<lb/> rest of the Commentaries (and, for that matter, Blackstone&apos;s entire<lb/> project) have drawn sharp criticism. It is reported that no less an<lb/> authority than Dr. Johnson remarked that Blackstone &quot;thought clearly,<lb/> but he thought faintly.&quot; 45 The Commentaries &quot;is widely believed to rest on<lb/> silly, ponderous, formal, conceptual, outdated, deductive, mechanistic,<lb/> naive and hopelessly unrealistic jurisprudence,&quot; 46 to be lacking in rigor, 47<lb/> and apparently riven by inconsistencies. 48 Especially for his effort to<lb/> satisfy the customary requirement of supplying his treatise with a general<lb/> introduction on the law, 49 Blackstone has received much criticism. 50<lb/> Beyond this, Blackstone seems largely to ignore the introductory doctrine<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> </table>

BLACKSTONE AND JUSTINIAN<lb/> Before seeing Blackstone as an Anglican it helps to see him as a civilian -<lb/>a master of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman law assembled<lb/> under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early sixth century. 55<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s own studies at Oxford made him well acquainted with<lb/> Roman law. 56 This acquaintance primed him for cultivating his Anglican<lb/> approach to the natural law, an approach that ends up looking very much<lb/> like that of Justinian.<lb/> As noted already, the Commentaries presents the laws of England<lb/> primarily as a body of substantive law. 57<lb/> This approach enabled<lb/> Blackstone to present the laws as a system, arranging them conceptually<lb/> by categories. 58 In this, the Commentaries resembles the Roman law<lb/> treatises of the ancient jurisconsult Gaius and of Justinian, whose<lb/> Institutes is a component of the Corpus Juris Civilis. 59 The Commentaries has<lb/> been likened to Justinian&apos;s work in both content and effect. 60<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> </table>

Intent on promulgating law for<lb/> the entire Roman world, Justinian hoped to justify Roman law as<lb/> universal by demonstrating that it reflected universal principles of law. Of<lb/> course, the Emperor looked to support his own legal regime, not to supply<lb/> arguments to criticize or attack it.

            <figDesc>Like other Reformation<lb/> theologians, Hooker asserts that Scripture and reason both convey to<lb/> humans the knowledge of God and of his eternal law. 121 &quot;It was part of<lb/> God&apos;s nature to work in an orderly and reasonable way . . . .&quot; 122<lb/> Consequently, &quot;God&apos;s own creation also worked in an orderly and<lb/> reasonable way,&quot; 123 a way ruled by law.

Against the Puritan threat of<lb/> &quot;singularity,&quot; lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a<lb/> distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately<lb/> by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce<lb/> obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker&apos;s view<lb/> that God teaches through human experience. 136<lb/> It also supports<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him<lb/> to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional<lb/> developments. </figDesc>
 
            <note>137<lb/> Third is the related matter of Hooker&apos;s use of history. For Hooker,<lb/> Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that<lb/> God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker&apos;s position<lb/> that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may<lb/> make laws, but in a sense those laws are God&apos;s as he works his providential<lb/> will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative<lb/> for Hooker. <note>143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to<lb/> English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as<lb/> </note>

            <note>182<lb/> One who could be viewed as the leading exponent of<lb/> Latitudinarianism in the next century, the century of Blackstone, is<lb/> Bishop Joseph Butler. 183 Butler published his most important work, The<lb/> Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed, in 1736 and it became hugely<lb/> influential in the middle of the century during the height of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> career and the writing of the Commentaries. 184 Relying on the same<lb/> principles that served Hooker, 185 Butler aimed to refute the deists on the<lb/> </note>

            <note>218<lb/> Again, Blackstone concurs with Butler in his argument that God has<lb/> ordered human affairs so that we need only pursue our own happiness to<lb/> find ourselves pursuing the law of nature that God has established for the<lb/> right ordering of our affairs. <note>219 For both Butler and Blackstone, reasonable<lb/> self-love motivates us to adhere to God&apos;s rule. <note>220 So here too, Blackstone<lb/> shows himself in the Commentaries aligning with the work of Butler as he<lb/> aligns with other elements of the Anglican tradition.<lb/> Blackstone had every reason to write the Commentaries from an<lb/> Anglican point of view.

            <note>As we have seen, Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries bears the impress of its<lb/> author&apos;s Anglican faith. This impress shapes the appearance of natural<lb/> law in the Commentaries, but by no means minimizes the role of natural<lb/> law.

<bibl>Joseph W.<lb/> McKnight, Blackstone: Quasi-Jurisprudent, 13 SW L.J. 399, 411 (1959). The present article<lb/> happens to highlight elements of the Commentaries that commended it to Americans<lb/> of the Founding: &quot;Even those who rejected Blackstone&apos;s anti-republican emphasis on<lb/> parliamentary omnipotence . . . had no difficulty in accepting the validity of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> exposition of English common law as founded on custom, divine law, and the law of<lb/> nature, hence providing an entirely appropriate legal foundation for the incipient USA.&quot;<lb/> Wilfrid Prest, General Editor&apos;s Introduction to 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES ON THE<lb/> LAWS OF ENGLAND, at vii, xiv (Wilfrid Prest ed., Oxford Univ.

Blackstone&apos;s use of natural law in the Commentaries may also reflect his<lb/> own introduction to the law. It was St. German&apos;s Doctor and Student, a work integrating<lb/> theological and legal thought, that drew Blackstone to the law. Cook, supra note 12, at<lb/> 170. Perhaps for similar reasons, the Commentaries turned students from theology to law.<lb/> McKnight, supra note 2, at 401.<lb/> Note that the pagination of the various editions of the Commentaries has become more or<lb/> less standardized.

(I-II, 91, 2,<lb/> observing, &quot;Now among all others, the rational creature is subject to Divine providence in<lb/> the most excellent way, in so far as it partakes of a share of providence, by being provident<lb/> both for itself and for others. Therefore it has a share of the Eternal Reason, by which it<lb/> has a natural inclination to its due act and end; and this participation of the eternal law in<lb/> the rational creature is called the natural law . . . [T]he natural law is nothing else than<lb/> the rational creature&apos;s participation of the eternal law&quot;).<lb/> </bibl>

But if in any point it differs from the law of<lb/> nature, it is no longer a law but a corruption of law.&quot;).<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>1</label> BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 41. For discussions of Aquinas&apos;s approach to the impact<lb/> of the Fall upon the operation of the natural law, see also CHARLES E. RICE, 50 QUESTIONS<lb/> ON THE NATURAL LAW 159-63 (1993) and Russell Hittinger, Natural Law and Catholic Moral<lb/> Philosophy, in A PRESERVING GRACE 1, 7-8 (Michael Cromartie ed., 1997). Hittinger finds<lb/> that Aquinas, &quot;[i]n his last recorded remarks on the subject of natural law,&quot; said:<lb/> Now although God in creating man gave him this law of nature,<lb/> the devil oversowed another law in man, namely, the law of<lb/> concupiscence. . . . Since then the law of nature was destroyed by<lb/> concupiscence, man needed to be brought back to works of virtue, and<lb/> to be drawn away from vice: for which purpose he needed the written<lb/> law.<lb/> Id. at 7 (citing Thomas Aquinas, Collations in Decem Praeceptis (1273)). </bibl>
        <bibl><label>1</label> id. at 42.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>Id.<lb/> Id. Examples of Blackstone&apos;s references to the divine law include his discussion of the law<lb/> of nuisance as enforcing &quot;that excellent rule of gospel-morality, of &apos;doing to others as we<lb/> would they should do unto ourselves,&apos;&quot; 3 id. at 218, and of the criminal law, 4 id. at 11, 30,<lb/> 42, 43, 60, including laws against homicide, id. at 177, dueling, id. at 199, and sodomy,<lb/> id. at 216. John Finnis has noted that Blackstone&apos;s endorsement of the role divine law is<lb/> to play in the formulation of human law does not lead him to confuse crime with sin. See<lb/> Finnis, supra note 24, at 177.<lb/> See supra note 7.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 209-10 (I-II, 91, 3, observing that, &quot;it is from the precepts<lb/> of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the human reason<lb/> needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular<lb/> determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws . . .&quot;). The Commentaries<lb/> is not wholly lacking this approach. For example: &quot;And sometimes, where the thing itself<lb/> has it&apos;s [sic] rise from the law of nature, the particular circumstances and mode of doing<lb/> it become right or wrong, as the laws of the land shall direct.&quot; 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note<lb/> 23, at 55.<lb/> The significant role in the Commentaries for human law to supply rules for matters<lb/> indifferent does not preclude a role for the law of nature (or natural law) in supplying<lb/> specific rules for human law. See, e.g., 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 435-36, 441<lb/> (discussing parents and children); </bibl>

The early classic effort to debunk the<lb/> Commentaries is JEREMY BENTHAM, A FRAGMENT ON GOVERNMENT (London, Thomas Payne<lb/> et al. 1776), but Bentham&apos;s target is as much the notion of natural law as the Commentaries<lb/> itself. Posner&apos;s article explains that Bentham&apos;s is a &quot;fundamentally misconceived attack<lb/> on the Commentaries.&quot; Id. at 569.<lb/> Alschuler, supra note 1, at 2.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>54 McKnight concurs in Hart&apos;s view of Blackstone&apos;s treatment of the law of nature and sees<lb/> it as making way for Blackstone&apos;s focus on indifferent matters. See McKnight, supra<lb/> note 2, at 405. McKnight&apos;s understanding also supports, if ironically, the argument that<lb/> Blackstone thereby paves the way for his own brand of natural law analysis. See infra notes<lb/> 309-12 and accompanying text.<lb/> Two other criticisms of the Commentaries deserve scant mention here. First, the radical<lb/> critique of Duncan Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, 28 BUFF. L. REV.<lb/> 205 (1979), that finds Blackstone &quot;supremely unconvincing.&quot; Id. at 211. Kennedy&apos;s<lb/> critique itself has been found supremely unconvincing.

<bibl>Watson, supra note 23, at 795, 802. Second, some commentators criticize<lb/> Blackstone on his discussion of absolute rights, as if his use of &quot;absolute&quot; means incapable<lb/> of diminishment or compromise. See, e.g., Lobban, supra note 50, at 329-30; McKnight,<lb/> supra note 2, at 401 n.16. This criticism falls aside upon paying more careful attention to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s usage:<lb/> THE rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are<lb/> also of two sorts, absolute, and relative. Absolute, which are such as<lb/> appertain and belong to particular men, merely as individuals or single<lb/> persons: relative, which are incident to them as members of society,<lb/> and standing in various relations to each other.<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>1</label> BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 119. &quot;Absolute&quot; means apart from social context, not<lb/> sacrosanct. See Watson, supra note 23, at 803.<lb/> For an introduction to Justinian and his work, see Craig A. Stern, Justinian: Lieutenant of<lb/> Christ, Legislator for Christendom, 11 REGENT U. L. REV. 1 (1998). Helmholz has remarked<lb/> that Blackstone was perhaps one-fifth a civilian, R.H. Helmholz, Natural Law and Human<lb/> Rights in English Law: From Bracton to Blackstone, 3 AVE MARIA L. REV. 1, 5 (2005), not so<lb/> small a fraction considering how imbued Blackstone was with the common law.<lb/> See Cook, supra note 12, at 170-72.<lb/> See supra text accompanying note 18.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>See Berring, supra note 16, at 191; Watson, supra note 23, at 810. It may be that Blackstone<lb/> came to this method owing to his &quot;academic persona.&quot; Wilfrid Prest, The Religion of a<lb/> Lawyer?: William Blackstone&apos;s Anglicanism, 21 PARERGON 153, 158 (2004).<lb/> </bibl>

Others have written that Blackstone&apos;s work is<lb/> fundamentally unlike Justinian&apos;s, Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 492-96, or failed<lb/> fundamentally by forcing the content of the common law into an unwelcoming structure<lb/> from Roman law.

McKnight, supra note 2, at 403 n.33. At<lb/> least one commentator has written that the common-law tradition reflects the notion that<lb/> innate reason has led the positive law to hold within itself the natural law. Lobban, supra<lb/> note 50, at 314. Similar to this link is the one Blackstone approvingly found to be advanced<lb/> by Aristotle: learning positive law is a good way to learn ethics.

If<lb/> Blackstone tags the law of property as governing things indifferent, see infra note 152 and<lb/> accompanying text, he does not thereby hold that property law is wholly without natural<lb/> law principles.

THORNTON, RICHARD HOOKER 32, 107 (1924). In this context Hooker calls law<lb/> &quot;positive&quot; if express revelation is necessary to know it. 1 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 220<lb/> n.1. Also, apparently unlike Blackstone, Hooker observes that the evidence of the senses<lb/> is clear and strong while that of revelation is complicated and complex. THORNTON, supra,<lb/> at 16. At the same time, however, the object held out in the Scriptures is more certain than<lb/> that in the senses. Id. at 18.<lb/> </bibl>

Also finding its way into the Commentaries<lb/> is Hooker&apos;s usage of the term lex gentium to mean international law rather than something<lb/> like the Roman usage of jus gentium discussed above at notes 88 to 89. Finnis, supra note<lb/> 24, at 177.<lb/> </bibl>
        <bibl><label>120</label> Of course, some role for human reason is found in standard views on the making of law,<lb/> with perhaps the classic being that of Aquinas. See, e.g., supra note 43.

        <bibl><label>151</label> While for Blackstone &quot;indifferent&quot; can mean diverse things, Finnis, supra note 24,<lb/> at 172-73, Blackstone imitates Hooker on biblical law, for example, acceding to its<lb/> authority but finding its still-obligatory moral law pertinent to very few issues. See<lb/> D. SEABORN DAVIES, THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH LAW 20 (1954). As to one such instance, it is<lb/> both intriguing and relevant to note that Blackstone observes that blood guilt-a concept<lb/> harking back to biblical standards-would adhere to Parliament were it to over-extend<lb/> capital punishment. 4 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 11. The Bible also speaks specifically<lb/> of blood guilt for over-extension of capital punishment. See DEUTERONOMY 19:4-10. See<lb/> generally Craig A.

<bibl>See Conklin, supra note 23, at 213-15. Conklin points out especially the affinity in<lb/> epistemology and the role of happiness.<lb/> See Blackstone&apos;s probabilism here, for example: &quot;But this [move of the Restoration<lb/> Parliament] was for the necessity of the thing, which supersedes all law; for if they had<lb/> not so met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace.&quot;<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 147 (emphasis added). And here: &quot;So that it is morally<lb/> impossible to trace out, with any degree of accuracy, when the several mutations of the<lb/> common law were made . . . .&quot; 4 id. at 402 (first emphasis added). The probabilism in<lb/> this use of &quot;morally impossible&quot; finds an explanation from Blackstone&apos;s contemporary,<lb/> Samuel Johnson:<lb/> He thus defined the difference between physical and moral truth:<lb/> &quot;Physical truth is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth<lb/> is, when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appears to you.<lb/> I say such a one walked across the street; if he really did so, I told a<lb/> physical truth. If I thought so, though I should have been mistaken, I<lb/> told a moral truth.&quot;<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>Compare BUTLER, supra note 196, at 68 (for Butler) with BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 53 (for<lb/> Blackstone). Conklin also finds that the pursuit of happiness is a linchpin for Blackstone,<lb/> Conklin, supra note 23, at 224, 260, but she places his approach also within the Common<lb/> Sense school, id. at 215-17. She attributes the phrase &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; in the<lb/> Declaration of Independence to Blackstone. Id. at 200-02. But see Craig A. Stern &amp; Gregory<lb/> M. Jones, The Coherence of Natural Inalienable Rights, 76 UMKC L. REV. 939, 973-74 (2008).<lb/> While Blackstone does subscribe to the notion that natural law bounds the validity of<lb/> human law, see supra text accompanying notes 32, 41; Posner, supra note 45, at 605, his<lb/> use of natural law embraces far more, Finnis, supra note 24, at 183.<lb/> </bibl>
<bibl>See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 78; see also 2 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 58 (describing<lb/> the &quot;ingenuity&quot; of the middle ages as one &quot;which perplexed all theology with the subtilty<lb/> of scholastic disquisitions, and bewildered philosophy in the mazes of metaphysical<lb/> jargon&quot;); </bibl>
<bibl>4 id. at 410-11 (bemoaning the scholastic intricacies of Norman jurisprudence).<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s approach avoided the complexities of the scholastics. See Conklin, supra<lb/> note 23, at 224. At the same time, while some note Blackstone&apos;s modern emphasis on<lb/> individual rights rather than on the classic common good, Finnis, supra note 24, at 181,<lb/> and on peace as the end of civil society, BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 179, and his &quot;social&quot;<lb/> rather than philosophical consistency, Brinton, supra note 204, at 704, Blackstone does<lb/> hold that society has a &quot;moral purpose,&quot; BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 190, and shares also<lb/> with Aquinas, see, e.g., 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 213-14 (I-II, 92, 1), 232-33 (I-II, 96,<lb/> 3), the belief that law has moral content, teaches right and wrong, and improves human<lb/> beings.

<bibl>See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 58.<lb/> See id. at 53, 60. Following Hale, Blackstone in the Commentaries treats the general<lb/> phenomenon of law under the guise of the law of England as an example historically<lb/> considered. Id. at 35-36.

Similarly, the Commentaries has been tagged as &quot;formalistic,<lb/> in the sense of describing the nominal power relationships, while failing to acknowledge<lb/> what he and other lawyers of his day knew to be the actual division of power and<lb/> influence.&quot; Langbein, supra note 14, at 70.<lb/> Hooker&apos;s use of history is treated above at notes 138 to 145.<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 62-64, 78.<lb/> See id. at 72-73; RICHARD TUCK, NATURAL RIGHTS THEORIES 84 (1979). One is reminded<lb/> also of Maine&apos;s characterization of the Roman law as aspiring to an &quot;indefinite<lb/> approximation&quot; to perfect law. See MAINE, supra note 24, at 63. Here again, Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> roots in Roman law complement his Anglicanism.<lb/> </bibl>

        <bibl><label>251</label> See LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 45. Boorstin writes that Blackstone employs a fiction that<lb/> English law expresses both &quot;the perfection of reason&quot; and &quot;the fullness of experience,&quot;<lb/> BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 135, but Blackstone asserts that legal customs, while often<lb/> rooted in natural law, are not always reasonable and so may stand in need of correction.<lb/> Compare, e.g., 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 251 (suggesting that a custom &quot;seems<lb/> dictated by nature herself&quot;) with id. at 280 (observing how an ancient rule of common law<lb/> &quot;was consonant neither to reason nor humanity&quot; and so endorsing its later alteration).<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 63.<lb/> LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 49. This approach was typical of English eighteenth-century<lb/> treatment of the law. Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 438.<lb/> See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 137 (asserting that the law of England &quot;is permanent,<lb/> fixed, and unchangeable, unless by authority of parliament&quot;); </bibl>

<bibl>Allen, supra note 21, at 202-05. Allen would have this use of fictions establish that the<lb/> Commentaries sees the law as a fabrication that does not reflect the way things really are.<lb/> Id. at 205. Fabrication the law may be, see supra text accompanying note 260, but the<lb/> point of fictions is to shape this fabric more accurately to reflect the way things really are<lb/> notwithstanding formulations of the positive law that otherwise would depart from the<lb/> way things really are. After all, that is the driving force behind fictions. See MAINE, supra<lb/> note 24, at 17-36.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 43. Blackstone reflects upon comparative law several times<lb/> in the Commentaries.

Again, this paper uses the term &quot;natural law&quot; for<lb/> what Blackstone usually called &quot;the law of nature.&quot; He himself defined &quot;natural law&quot; to<lb/> be human theorizing about the law of nature, see id., though his actual usage seems not to<lb/> be uniform on this point, see supra note 7.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>See DAVIES, supra note 151, at 16, 21.<lb/> In keeping with its comparatist approach, the Commentaries with seeming approval notes<lb/> within or alongside the common law itself a diversity of sources and even of rules of law.<lb/> See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 63-64, 74-78; 4 Id. at 403.<lb/> See Alschuler, supra note 1, at 2, 24-27.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>Posner, supra note 45, at 579, 590. The Commentaries is so dedicated to this tracing of<lb/> reasons that at least one commentator tags the reasons as &quot;often shallow, formalistic,<lb/> indeed sometimes plain dishonest.&quot; Langbein, supra note 14, at 77.<lb/> See MOSSNER, supra note 167, at 25.<lb/> BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 121.<lb/> See Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 502. Although reasonableness became a hallmark of<lb/> Butler and the Latitudinarians, reasonableness figures in Hooker&apos;s work also. See VOAK,<lb/> supra note 118, at 137. Perhaps in some distinction from &quot;reasonableness,&quot; &quot;reason&quot; had<lb/> longed served as a touchstone of English law. See NORMAN DOE, FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY<lb/> IN LATE MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LAW 83, 106-31, 153, 176-77 (1990). Blackstone no doubt draws<lb/> upon this tradition as well as upon post-Reformation Anglicanism.<lb/> See Lobban, supra note 50, at 334; Posner, supra note 45, at 572. Posner discovers the<lb/> maximization of welfare in Blackstone&apos;s approach, Posner 573-74, much as Maine found<lb/> &quot;utilitarianism&quot; in the Roman law, McKnight, supra note 2, at 406 n.67. Finnis notes<lb/> that Blackstone in some respects bases even the human institution of rights upon reason.<lb/> Finnis, supra note 24, at 166.<lb/> Lobban describes this as supplying a natural law &quot;external test of reasonableness of the<lb/> law.&quot; Lobban, supra note 50, at 333.<lb/> </bibl>

<bibl>See Finnis, supra note 24, at 181; David Lemmings, Editor&apos;s Introduction to Book I of 1<lb/> BLACKSTONE, supra note 2, at xvii, xxxi. H.L.A.

        <bibl><label>311</label> See Lobban, supra note 50, at 324; McKnight, supra note 2, at 404-06.<lb/> Again, it bears repeating that &quot;the reality of things&quot; speaks not only of mere physicality<lb/> but also of the norms appropriate to the situation at hand. The reality of things holds as<lb/> much ought as is. See supra notes 66-76 and accompanying text.<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 65, 68.<lb/> See Posner, supra note 45, at 604.<lb/> </bibl>

        <bibl><label>1</label> BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 69; see also 3 id. at 327 (&quot;For though in many other<lb/> countries every thing is left in the breast of the judge to determine, yet with us he is only<lb/> to declare and pronounce, not to make or new-model, the law&quot;). This understanding of<lb/> the work of the judge is in keeping with Blackstone&apos;s view of the use of reason in law to<lb/> discover, not to invent. See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 51, 123.

That Blackstone does not subscribe to judicial review, see 1<lb/> BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 91; Helmholz, supra note 55, at 14, in no way compromises<lb/> his commitment to natural law.

<bibl>See RICHARD A.

See D&apos;ENTRÈVES,supra<lb/> note 61, at 151.

			<p>England (hereinafter Commentaries). <ref type="biblio">1</ref> No other book but the Bible had a<lb/> greater role in generating American institutions <ref type="biblio">2</ref> and the nineteenth<lb/> century alone saw about one hundred American versions. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> It is said that<lb/> the Commentaries led early American courts to decide from principles, not<lb/> precedents. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> But it is said also that the Commentaries is of questionable<lb/> merit, <ref type="biblio">5</ref> with aspects of it downright incoherent. <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> The most fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this<lb/> disparaging characterization is its discussion and use of what it usually<lb/> calls &quot;the law of nature.&quot; <ref type="biblio">7</ref> &quot;Natural law&quot; is the term more frequently used<lb/> these days for a transcendent legal order to which human law necessarily<lb/> bears some relationship. Because Blackstone&apos;s concept of the &quot;law of<lb/> nature&quot; is similar to that of contemporary &quot;natural law,&quot; this article<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/></ref> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></p>

			<p>often will use the latter term instead. In this parlance, the concern<lb/> becomes the charge of incoherence in Blackstone&apos;s discussion and use of<lb/> natural law. Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually many<lb/> mistakes -of natural law?<lb/></p>

			<p>This article proposes that it is not the Commentaries, but rather its<lb/> critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from<lb/> the expectation that Blackstone&apos;s natural law would take after Thomas<lb/> Aquinas&apos;s <ref type="biblio">8</ref> (or even Christopher St.German&apos;s) 9 natural law. As Blackstone<lb/> disappoints these expectations, he has met with criticisms that his<lb/> treatment of natural law is a sloppy pro forma performance that even he<lb/> himself does not take seriously. But readers of the Commentaries who<lb/> allow Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable<lb/> treatment that animates the whole of the Commentaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone&apos;s natural law owes much to two influences. The first is<lb/> Roman law, especially as captured in the Corpus Juris Civilis. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> The second<lb/> is the Anglican church, <ref type="biblio">11</ref> which is the more distinctive and guides<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural<lb/> law as an order immanent in human law, an order especially prominent<lb/> within the common law. Seen in this light, natural law provides the<lb/> foundation for the Commentaries. While doing so, it also provides a<lb/> foundation for understanding law even today, a foundation actually in use<lb/> far more than some might think.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. THE COMMENTARIES AND THE COMMENTATORS<lb/></head>

			<p>After unproductive struggles to develop a successful practice at the bar,<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s professional life began to flourish with his Oxford lectures<lb/> on the common law. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> The Commentaries is not these lectures merely<lb/> recast, delivered as they were to an audience of mere teenagers. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> Nevertheless, the Commentaries is designed to teach and Blackstone<lb/> wanted his readers to learn. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> The readers for whom he wrote were<lb/> &quot;young nobility and gentry,&quot; 15 the leading laymen of the realm. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Chief<lb/> among these were those who were or would become legislators, and<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone was determined to instruct them not to harm by statute the<lb/> liberties of Englishmen. <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref> Blackstone&apos;s aim to instruct lay readers shaped the Commentaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>This aim trained the focus of the Commentaries upon substantive rules of<lb/> law, lending the Commentaries both its pathbreaking distinctive and also<lb/> the daunting obstacle to its creation. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> Blackstone&apos;s object was to teach<lb/> laymen the laws of property, crimes, torts, and such -not how to draft<lb/> legal instruments or plead at bar. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Beyond teaching the substance of the<lb/> law to laymen, this substantive-law focus gave &quot;lawyers a new vision of<lb/> the law.&quot; <ref type="biblio">20</ref> The Commentaries imposed order and a clarifying system on the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/></ref> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></p>

			<p>jumble that was English law. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> This arrangement was a key to its success. <ref type="biblio">22<lb/></ref> It is Blackstone&apos;s use of natural law that undergirds this arrangement. <ref type="biblio">23<lb/></ref> Near the beginning of the Commentaries is Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> introductory discussion of law. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Law is &quot;a rule of action dictated by some<lb/> superior being,&quot; and laws considered as rules for human conduct are &quot;the<lb/> precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature<lb/> endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded to make use of<lb/> those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior.&quot; <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The obligation<lb/> to obey law derives from dependence upon the lawgiver, &quot;[a]nd<lb/> consequently as man depends absolutely upon his maker for every thing,<lb/> it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker&apos;s will.<lb/></p>

			<p>THIS will of his maker is called the law of nature.&quot; <ref type="biblio">26</ref> In its scope,<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Blackstone&apos;s law of nature reminds one of Aquinas&apos;s natural law. 27<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>The voluntaristic stamp of Blackstone&apos;s law of nature -it is the will of<lb/> God -diminishes somewhat in the next words of the Commentaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>God&apos;s wisdom leads him to prescribe only what corresponds to the nature<lb/> of things and in this he conforms to &quot;the eternal, immutable laws of good<lb/> and evil.&quot; <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Human reason is able to discover these laws, and God&apos;s<lb/> goodness leads him to link our happiness with obedience to the law of<lb/> nature. &quot;For he has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven<lb/> the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the<lb/> latter cannot be obtained but by observing the former; and, if the former<lb/> be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter.&quot; 29 This link between<lb/> the law of nature and human happiness &quot;is the foundation of what we call<lb/> ethics, or natural law.&quot; 30 Natural law comprises articles that &quot;amount to<lb/> no more than demonstrating, that this or that action tends to man&apos;s real<lb/> happiness, and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it<lb/> is a part of the law of nature.&quot; <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref> Blackstone then renders explicit the supreme authority of the law of<lb/> nature:<lb/></p>

			<p>THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated<lb/> by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times:<lb/></p>

			<p>no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such<lb/> of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority,<lb/> mediately or immediately, from this original.</p>

			<figure type="table">32<lb/> Again, Blackstone&apos;s law of nature brings to mind Aquinas&apos;s natural law. 33<lb/> But Blackstone&apos;s approach to what he calls natural law differs<lb/> profoundly from that of Aquinas. We already have noted that the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> Commentaries describes natural law as a set of demonstrations that<lb/> certain human conduct leads to human happiness and consequently<lb/> comports with the law of nature. 34 This description is nothing like<lb/> Aquinas&apos;s description of natural law as the participation of human beings<lb/> in the eternal law, or perhaps vice versa. 35 This difference between<lb/> Blackstone and Aquinas becomes yet clearer in the former&apos;s comparison<lb/> of divine law with natural law.<lb/> Although human reason before the Fall sufficed to discover the<lb/> precepts of the law of nature, human reason after the Fall &quot;is corrupt, and<lb/> [human] understanding full of ignorance and error.&quot; 36 Therefore, God of<lb/> his compassion has informed us of the law of nature &quot;by . . . immediate<lb/> and direct revelation.&quot; 37 &quot;The doctrines thus delivered we call the<lb/> revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy<lb/> scriptures.&quot; 38 So the natural law and the divine law both bespeak the law<lb/> of nature.<lb/> Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of<lb/> infinite more authority than what we generally call the natural<lb/> law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to<lb/> be by God himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of<lb/> human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as<lb/> See supra text accompanying note 31.<lb/> See supra note 27.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an<lb/> equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any<lb/> competition together. <ref type="biblio">39<lb/></ref> Natural law is &quot;only what . . . we imagine to be&quot; the law of nature. <ref type="biblio">40<lb/></ref> The Commentaries continues with further observations on the<lb/> relationship between these laws and human law:<lb/></p>

			<p>UPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of<lb/> revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human<lb/> laws should be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a<lb/> great number of indifferent points, in which both the divine law<lb/> and the natural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are<lb/> found necessary for the benefit of society to be restrained<lb/> within certain limits. And herein it is that human laws have<lb/> their greatest force and efficacy; for, with regard to such points<lb/> as are not indifferent, human laws are only declaratory of, and<lb/> act in subordination to, the former.</p>

			<figure type="table">41<lb/> Two elements of this excerpt warrant special notice. First is Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> usage of the &quot;law of nature&quot; and the &quot;natural law.&quot; As mentioned<lb/> above, 42 his usage sometimes seems to depart from distinguishing the<lb/> two, with natural law as a merely human construct thought to resemble<lb/> the actual law of nature. On one reading, such a departure appears in this<lb/> passage.<lb/> The second element is the connection between matters<lb/> indifferent -matters for which the law of nature does not prescribe a<lb/> specific rule -and human law. While there is a firm link between the<lb/> laws of nature and human law, it appears that human law largely<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> concerns itself with matters indifferent. Whereas Aquinas casts human<lb/> law essentially in the position of providing determinations that apply<lb/> rules of the natural law in particular contexts, 43 Blackstone sees human<lb/> law having greatest play where the law of nature appears mute. This<lb/> significant role in his analysis for things indifferent owes a major debt to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican point of view. 44<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s introductory remarks on law and their relation to the<lb/> rest of the Commentaries (and, for that matter, Blackstone&apos;s entire<lb/> project) have drawn sharp criticism. It is reported that no less an<lb/> authority than Dr. Johnson remarked that Blackstone &quot;thought clearly,<lb/> but he thought faintly.&quot; 45 The Commentaries &quot;is widely believed to rest on<lb/> silly, ponderous, formal, conceptual, outdated, deductive, mechanistic,<lb/> naive and hopelessly unrealistic jurisprudence,&quot; 46 to be lacking in rigor, 47<lb/> and apparently riven by inconsistencies. 48 Especially for his effort to<lb/> satisfy the customary requirement of supplying his treatise with a general<lb/> introduction on the law, 49 Blackstone has received much criticism. 50<lb/> Beyond this, Blackstone seems largely to ignore the introductory doctrine<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> he supplies once his introduction is behind him. 51 H.L.A. Hart has argued<lb/> that Blackstone does not use the law of nature to support English law, and<lb/> that his natural law test of the validity of positive law is vacuous in any<lb/> event. 52 Although these arguments have not gone unanswered, 53 they<lb/> actually point not to defects but rather to the very natural law technique<lb/> Blackstone uses in his discussion of English law in the Commentaries, the<lb/> technique based upon his Anglican understanding. 54<lb/> The Commentaries has suffered at the hands of some commentators.<lb/> The introductory explanation of the law of nature and natural law has been<lb/> a popular target of criticism. So has Blackstone&apos;s use -or rather non-use<lb/> -of these elements when he develops his commentaries on the laws of<lb/> England proper. Nevertheless, a more liberal appreciation of his work will<lb/> notice a highly developed and broadly used natural law approach in those<lb/> commentaries. This appreciation, however, must be attuned to discerning<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> a use of the natural law that Blackstone&apos;s own introduction may not have<lb/> foretold for his readers today.<lb/> 3. BLACKSTONE AND JUSTINIAN<lb/> Before seeing Blackstone as an Anglican it helps to see him as a civilian -<lb/>a master of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman law assembled<lb/> under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early sixth century. 55<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s own studies at Oxford made him well acquainted with<lb/> Roman law. 56 This acquaintance primed him for cultivating his Anglican<lb/> approach to the natural law, an approach that ends up looking very much<lb/> like that of Justinian.<lb/> As noted already, the Commentaries presents the laws of England<lb/> primarily as a body of substantive law. 57<lb/> This approach enabled<lb/> Blackstone to present the laws as a system, arranging them conceptually<lb/> by categories. 58 In this, the Commentaries resembles the Roman law<lb/> treatises of the ancient jurisconsult Gaius and of Justinian, whose<lb/> Institutes is a component of the Corpus Juris Civilis. 59 The Commentaries has<lb/> been likened to Justinian&apos;s work in both content and effect. 60<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> Like the Commentaries, the Corpus Juris Civilis presents abstract<lb/> introductory discussions of natural law 61 and manifests its actual use of<lb/> natural law in the body of the work, the treatment of the law of Rome.<lb/> Drawing on the universal and supreme authority of natural law, Justinian<lb/> used it to support and explain Roman law. Intent on promulgating law for<lb/> the entire Roman world, Justinian hoped to justify Roman law as<lb/> universal by demonstrating that it reflected universal principles of law. Of<lb/> course, the Emperor looked to support his own legal regime, not to supply<lb/> arguments to criticize or attack it. The dignity and universal authority of<lb/> the natural law lay ready to lend dignity and universal authority to Roman<lb/> law. 62<lb/></figure>

			<p>Beyond lending this support, the natural law helped explain the<lb/> rules of Roman law. Natural and Roman law were viewed as intertwined,<lb/> so much so that natural law was best seen through existing Roman law,<lb/> the celebrated simplicity and harmony of which derived from this<lb/> relationship. <ref type="biblio">63</ref> As in classical Greek thought on natural law, natural law<lb/> was understood to be from the &quot;aboriginal design of nature,&quot; but Roman<lb/> thinking also understood actual, positive Roman law to approximate the<lb/> ideal natural law, gradually conforming to it more fully. <ref type="biblio">64</ref> Far from a<lb/> revolutionary doctrine, the Roman natural law approach encouraged<lb/> Roman lawyers to find the natural law in positive law. <ref type="biblio">65<lb/></ref> In actual operation, Roman natural law concerned itself with<lb/> conforming legal rules to the nature of things. <ref type="biblio">66</ref></p>

 It sought the intrinsic<lb/> character of legal subjects, applying natural reason to the facts of the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> matter at hand. 67 A master of both natural law theory and Roman law<lb/> likens this work to developing rules for preparing flaky piecrust. 68<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Commentaries makes use of natural law in much the same<lb/> way. <ref type="biblio">69</ref> Far from using natural law to trump the law of England, 70 and only<lb/> rarely using natural law to criticize English law, <ref type="biblio">71</ref> Blackstone follows the<lb/> Roman natural law tradition in explaining why English law is as it is. <ref type="biblio">72<lb/></ref> This use is in keeping with Blackstone&apos;s practical rather than theoretical<lb/> bent. <ref type="biblio">73</ref> Like the natural law of the Roman lawyer, <ref type="biblio">74</ref> Blackstone&apos;s natural<lb/> law unites is with ought, seeking norms from the nature of things, 75 but<lb/> with more warrant. 76<lb/></p>

			<p>A good example of this technique is offered by Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> explanation of the law of property. As Professor Graham has explained,<lb/> the Commentaries does not present irrational support of old ways but<lb/> rather a studied focus on the physical nature of things. <ref type="biblio">77</ref> From nature and<lb/> the natural order in physical context, for example, Blackstone evolves a<lb/> &quot;natural history&quot; of property to rationalize English property law. <ref type="biblio">78</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Natural law inheres in the nature of things, and the law of England, like<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>Roman law, developed in light of this natural law. <ref type="biblio">79<lb/></ref> The Commentaries holds many instances where Blackstone<lb/> explicitly explains that English law is true to the nature of things -<lb/>sometimes presented as fulfilling the obligation of the law to reflect<lb/> &quot;necessity.&quot; This, after he notes that the law of nature inheres in the<lb/> nature of things, 80 and that sound Roman laws took &quot;the nature of things<lb/> for their guide.&quot; 81 Some examples: Blackstone establishes the obligation<lb/> of allegiance to civil government upon the nature of civil government. <ref type="biblio">82<lb/></ref> The legal relationship between husband and wife is founded in nature. <ref type="biblio">83<lb/></ref> Necessity has given rise to the law of property, 84 and laws on personal<lb/> property take into account their transitory nature. <ref type="biblio">85</ref> The laws of civil<lb/> wrongs derive in several respects from the nature of things, often human<lb/> nature, 86 and criminal laws likewise derive from the nature of things or<lb/> reflect the nature of things. <ref type="biblio">87</ref> In these instances, Blackstone seems to<lb/> hark back to the Roman law, rooted as it was in the nature of things.<lb/></p>

			<p>Roman law makes its appearance in the Commentaries in at least<lb/> two other general ways that support Blackstone&apos;s Anglican approach to<lb/> the law. First is its concept of the jus gentium, the law of nations. If the<lb/> natural law truly is universal, one would expect it -or projections from it<lb/> -to be found in the laws of all nations. The law of nations, understood as<lb/> the body of laws to be found widespread among the nations of the earth,<lb/> therefore becomes a window on natural law, as the Romans believed.</p>

			<figure type="table">88<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>This value of the jus gentium is evident in Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> comparative law. He looks to law outside England not so much to<lb/> disparage non-English law as to find points of commonality. Those<lb/> points support English law by suggesting that it rests upon natural law<lb/> foundations. <ref type="biblio">89</ref> A similar cast in Anglican theology could therefore offer a<lb/> link and support to Blackstone&apos;s approach to the law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond its content, another aspect of Roman law that influenced<lb/> the Commentaries and would harmonize well with an Anglican<lb/> understanding of the law is the process of the development of Roman law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Roman law developed over hundreds of years, largely case by case. <ref type="biblio">90</ref> In<lb/> this respect, its development paralleled that of English common law.<lb/></p>

			<p>While Roman law came to repose nearly exclusively in the Corpus Juris<lb/> Civilis, <ref type="biblio">91</ref> English law rejected such codification in favor of its commitment<lb/> to the method by which Roman law developed. <ref type="biblio">92</ref> Some have noted that<lb/> Blackstone took the view of a practicing lawyer and judge in the<lb/> Commentaries, <ref type="biblio">93</ref> and though it was famously said that, &quot;In England less<lb/> attention is paid to natural law than anywhere else in the world,&quot; <ref type="biblio">94<lb/></ref> Blackstone used natural law arguments successfully at the bar. <ref type="biblio">95</ref> The<lb/> common law -the law of cases -required barristers and judges to<lb/> consider cases with an eye to their context.</p>

			<figure type="table">This technique largely<lb/> provided the materials Blackstone assembled in the Commentaries. It is a<lb/> technique that befits the Anglican way, a technique that developed law<lb/> that itself befits the Anglican way. It also was the way of Roman lawyers.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> If common law judges in deciding cases were making law up, they were<lb/> making it up to fit. 96<lb/> Blackstone, student of Roman law, reflected a Roman law approach<lb/> to the natural law in the Commentaries. Beginning, like the Digest and<lb/> Institutes of the Corpus Juris Civilis, with an abstract exposition of natural<lb/> law and related formulations, the body of the Commentaries puts natural<lb/> law most to use in explaining and justifying particular rules of law.<lb/> Seeking the dictates of reason and the guide of reasonableness,<lb/> Blackstone rests rules of law upon the nature of the matter at hand -a<lb/> typically Roman technique. In this and other respects, Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> natural law fits well with the Anglican stance on natural law that he<lb/> adopts in the Commentaries.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4. BLACKSTONE AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND<lb/></head>

			<figure type="table">No surprise that Sir William Blackstone, Oxford don, justice of both the<lb/> King&apos;s Bench and Common Pleas, was an Anglican. What may surprise is<lb/> how serious an Anglican Blackstone was, and how deeply his Anglicanism<lb/> influenced the jurisprudence of his Commentaries.<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s deep and pervasive Christian faith was manifest. 97 As<lb/> a young man he took a serious interest in religion, 98 and made a careful<lb/> investigation<lb/> of<lb/> Anglicanism 99<lb/> before<lb/> committing<lb/> himself<lb/> wholeheartedly to orthodox Anglicanism. 100<lb/> He celebrated his<lb/> commitment in a poem, a vision of diverse faiths in which he praised the<lb/> Church of England for its moderation, liberty, support of science,<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> reforming influence, and virtue. 101 Although a committed Anglican,<lb/> Blackstone was not so committed that he could brook no Dissenters, 102<lb/> going so far as to alter the Commentaries in light of Dissenter reaction to<lb/> an earlier edition of the work. 103 The general Anglican understanding of<lb/> providential development from primitive sources 104 and the important<lb/> role reason plays in perceiving truth 105 would support Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> construction of the Commentaries.<lb/></figure>

			<head>The substantial alignments between Anglican theology and the<lb/></head>

			<p>Commentaries are the focus of the next pages of this article.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. RICHARD HOOKER<lb/></head>

			<p>Key to the Church of England is the work of the Elizabethan divine,<lb/> Richard Hooker. <ref type="biblio">106</ref> Beyond helping to shape the contours of Anglicanism<lb/> as a whole, Hooker&apos;s influence on legal theory was especially<lb/> pronounced. <ref type="biblio">107<lb/></ref> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican understanding of the law<lb/> necessarily reflects Hooker&apos;s understanding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hooker held law in high esteem:<lb/></p>

			<p>[O]f Law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is<lb/> the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world: all things<lb/> in heaven and in earth do her homage, the very least as feeling<lb/> her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Angels and men and creatures of what condition soever, though<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent,<lb/> admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy. <ref type="biblio">108<lb/></ref> Law for Hooker is fundamental. <ref type="biblio">109</ref> Furthermore, his treatment of law is<lb/> no incidental matter but derives from his theology. 110 Law, as one might<lb/> gather from the excerpt just quoted, reigns over politics. In this, Hooker<lb/> departs from an Aristotelian view, <ref type="biblio">111</ref> and follows, as elsewhere, the<lb/> magisterial reformers rather than Augustine or Aquinas. <ref type="biblio">112<lb/></ref> Hooker goes so far as to hold that God himself works according to<lb/> law, <ref type="biblio">113</ref> and for at least one commentator, Hooker holds that God is law.</p>

			<figure type="table">114 A<lb/> famous apothegm of Hooker states that &quot;the being of God is a kind of law<lb/> to his working.&quot; 115<lb/> In some respects, Hooker&apos;s general discussion of the fundamental<lb/> types of law adumbrates that of Blackstone. Hooker explains that, in his<lb/> usage, both the law of nature and divine law reveal eternal law to<lb/> humankind. 116 At the same time, however, Hooker holds divine law to be<lb/> positive law, a creature of God&apos;s reason and will both, whereas for<lb/> Blackstone it is simply a revelation of the law of nature. 117 Likewise,<lb/> Hooker sees some human law as an adaptation of natural law, and other<lb/> human law as an ordinance &quot;merely human,&quot; reasonable and convenient<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>for the time and place. <ref type="biblio">118</ref> A similar formulation of human law will find its<lb/> way into the Commentaries. <ref type="biblio">119<lb/></ref> The line from Hooker to Blackstone is more clearly traced along<lb/> particular elements to be found in the works of both. One is the role of<lb/> human reason in the development of law. <ref type="biblio">120</ref></p>

 Like other Reformation<lb/> theologians, Hooker asserts that Scripture and reason both convey to<lb/> humans the knowledge of God and of his eternal law. 121 &quot;It was part of<lb/> God&apos;s nature to work in an orderly and reasonable way . . . .&quot; 122<lb/> Consequently, &quot;God&apos;s own creation also worked in an orderly and<lb/> reasonable way,&quot; 123 a way ruled by law. God acts to accomplish his<lb/> &quot;rational purpose.&quot; 124 So for Hooker, the appeal to reason becomes<lb/> key. 125 The law of reason is for all humans, 126 endowed as they are with &quot;a<lb/> natural practical wisdom.&quot; 127 Humans find themselves ruled by the law of<lb/> reason, divine law, and human law 128 -the last resting upon rational<lb/> human nature 129 and either resolving &quot;probable matters&quot; or &quot;clarify[ing]<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> and enforc[ing] the necessary precepts of reason.&quot; 130 The authority<lb/> Hooker grants to human reason, a touchstone of Anglicanism, holds sway<lb/> in the Commentaries, as shall appear. 131<lb/> A second major influence of Hooker upon Blackstone is his<lb/> endorsement of the authority of custom. Against the Puritan threat of<lb/> &quot;singularity,&quot; lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a<lb/> distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately<lb/> by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce<lb/> obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker&apos;s view<lb/> that God teaches through human experience. 136<lb/> It also supports<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him<lb/> to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional<lb/> developments. 137<lb/> Third is the related matter of Hooker&apos;s use of history. For Hooker,<lb/> Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that<lb/> God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker&apos;s position<lb/> that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may<lb/> make laws, but in a sense those laws are God&apos;s as he works his providential<lb/> will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative<lb/> for Hooker. 143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to<lb/> English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> an emphasis on historical continuity. 145 For Blackstone, history is the key<lb/> to understanding English law. 146<lb/> The last marked influence of Hooker on Blackstone is the<lb/> importance of the concept of things indifferent, matters not conclusively<lb/> ordained by transcendent law but rather left more to human<lb/> determination. 147 Positive laws may resolve matters that God leaves to<lb/> human liberty. 148 So, while some human laws are based upon natural<lb/> law, 149 its necessary tenets are few, leaving most matters to public<lb/> authority. 150 Blackstone takes a similar tack 151 : Daniel Boorstin has<lb/> discussed the remarkable degree to which Blackstone holds that private<lb/> property itself is a creature of civil law. 152 Crimes not mala in se but rather<lb/> those &quot;with regard to things in themselves indifferent . . . become either<lb/> right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or misdemeanors, according as the<lb/> municipal legislator sees proper.&quot; 153 &quot;Lands are not naturally descendible<lb/> any more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit<lb/> and peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as well<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> as the other.&quot; 154 Regarding the jurisdiction of courts, &quot;[e]very nation<lb/> must and will abide by it&apos;s [sic] own municipal laws; which various<lb/> accidents conspire to render different in almost every country in<lb/> Europe.&quot; 155 Apart from these specific observations regarding indifferent<lb/> matters, Blackstone&apos;s chief use of natural law paradoxically guides the<lb/> resolution of matters that, in a sense, are indifferent. 156 More on this use<lb/> later. 157<lb/> The teaching of Hooker was not lost on the English legal theorists<lb/> that followed. Edward Coke viewed the law as reason in history -reason<lb/> in the sense of reasonable, not rationalistic -and understood that<lb/> natural law was incorporated into human law. 158 Even more than Coke,<lb/> Matthew Hale especially influenced Blackstone in the Commentaries. 159<lb/> Like Hooker, Hale saw natural law and divine law as authoritative but also<lb/> as speaking only to a limited set of questions. 160<lb/> Likewise, Hale<lb/> understood history as providence, 161 with positive law accordingly<lb/> developed through time. 162 This historical focus finds its way from Hale<lb/> into the Commentaries. 163 Also, both Hale&apos;s locating reason within a<lb/> particular object (in addition to its being a human faculty) and his debt to<lb/> natural science and empiricism 164 seem reflected in the Commentaries. 165<lb/> The Anglicanism of Hooker, Coke, and Hale, and their emphasis on<lb/> reason and history alongside the authority of natural law and Holy Writ,<lb/> are to be seen in Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries. An even clearer influence on<lb/> Id. at 185.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.2. THE LATITUDINARIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>The Anglican Church faced the Age of Reason and Deism with<lb/> Latitudinarianism. <ref type="biblio">166<lb/></ref> Though standing in opposition to those two<lb/> developments, the Latitudinarians, as their name implies, embraced<lb/> tolerance as their major theme. <ref type="biblio">167</ref> This theme in no way compromised<lb/> their commitment to God and the Christian faith. The Latitudinarians<lb/> believed that God holds an absolute claim on humanity and that all our<lb/> powers depend upon his will. <ref type="biblio">168</ref></p>

 Christianity is to govern all of life. 169<lb/> Education for moral and spiritual reformation is especially important. 170<lb/> With these tenets Latitudinarianism was a major force in seventeenth<lb/> century Anglicanism.<lb/> It also was in important respects a movement in continuity with<lb/> the work of Hooker, a continuity that would support the work of<lb/> Blackstone. The Latitudinarians in their tolerance relied upon Hooker&apos;s<lb/> emphasis on things indifferent. 171<lb/> They also shared Hooker&apos;s<lb/> endorsement of strong laws. 172<lb/> Beyond these particulars, the most important influence of<lb/> Latitudinarianism to be seen in the Commentaries, and well within the<lb/> trajectory Hooker set for the Anglican Church, was its appreciation for<lb/> reason as a guide in human affairs. Latitudinarian thought was well<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> suited to the development of science 173 : it is no accident that Isaac<lb/> Newton was an Anglican. 174 The Latitudinarians understood that human<lb/> reason did not survive the Fall unimpaired. 175 At the same time, however,<lb/> some power of human reason persists. 176 Human reason under God is able<lb/> to understand nature, itself existing under the Sovereign God. 177 This<lb/> human reason is not the reason of rationalism, but instead more like<lb/> common sense. 178 And just as reason is an aid to understanding the<lb/> Bible, 179 so is the Bible a necessary aid to the use of reason. 180<lb/> Latitudinarians favored reason and the philosophical explanation of<lb/> reality, 181 but more important to Blackstone&apos;s jurisprudence was their<lb/> view that reason was useful especially for discerning natural law. 182<lb/> One who could be viewed as the leading exponent of<lb/> Latitudinarianism in the next century, the century of Blackstone, is<lb/> Bishop Joseph Butler. 183 Butler published his most important work, The<lb/> Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed, in 1736 and it became hugely<lb/> influential in the middle of the century during the height of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> career and the writing of the Commentaries. 184 Relying on the same<lb/> principles that served Hooker, 185 Butler aimed to refute the deists on the<lb/> grounds of natural theology. 186<lb/> As Blackstone would argue, 187 the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> creature owes a duty to the creator, and design proves a designer. 188<lb/> Likewise, general laws govern nature, 189 with the nature of things giving<lb/> rise to right and wrong, thus determining God&apos;s will. 190 Humans are able<lb/> to discover their duties through reason -more the reasonable dictate of<lb/> God&apos;s will than the deliverances of logic. 191 Blackstone would also endorse<lb/> Butler&apos;s view of civil government as an agency of God&apos;s government<lb/> concerned with social consequences. 192<lb/> Two major aspects of Butler&apos;s theology to lodge in the Commentaries<lb/> command attention here. The first is emphasis on experience. We have<lb/> noted Butler&apos;s emphasis on reason, that is on reasonableness more than<lb/> cold logic. 193 Nevertheless, humankind cannot by speculation judge what<lb/> leads to human perfection or happiness. 194 Hooker had held that the degree<lb/> of certainty we attain is relative to the nature of things. 195 Like him, Butler<lb/> held that we should not expect to plumb the depths of all knowledge and<lb/> understanding, but rather follow the light we do have. 196<lb/> That light largely is the product of experience. The laws by which<lb/> God governs are known to us by reason along with experience. 197 As<lb/> science and medicine developed by progressive advances, 198 so ethics<lb/> depends upon empirical evidence and common sense, and morality itself<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> is a science of human action with attention paid to the facts of results. 199<lb/> God uses our experience to teach us duties. 200 As with physics, so with<lb/> human laws, experiment, inductive method, and judgment based upon<lb/> the generality of observations are sound guides. 201 Experience, resting<lb/> upon God&apos;s governance by punishment and reward, 202 is a surer guide<lb/> than abstract reason. 203<lb/> Blackstone suited the Commentaries to his readers, enlightened<lb/> eighteenth-century Anglicans. 204 He himself was committed to English<lb/> enlightenment principles 205 and Butler&apos;s welcome to progress,<lb/> knowledge, and experience 206 suited Blackstone well. Like Edmund<lb/> Burke, 207 Blackstone embraced Latitudinarianism and the work of Joseph<lb/> Butler. 208 He subscribed to the test of probability rather than certainty, 209<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> reasonableness as a touchstone of truth, 210 and common sense coupled<lb/> with experience. 211 The large role in the Commentaries played by history<lb/> may be ascribed, at least in part, to this regard for experience. 212<lb/> A second aspect of Butler&apos;s theology that helped shape the<lb/> Commentaries is the importance and function of human happiness. 213 God<lb/> governs mankind by reward, by the consequences of human actions. 214<lb/> Therefore, true happiness directs us towards doing God&apos;s will. 215 This<lb/> happiness (supplemented by conscience 216 ) defies certain demonstration,<lb/> but does make itself known with &quot;practical proof.&quot; 217 To pursue virtue is<lb/> to pursue happiness, and to pursue happiness is to pursue virtue. 218<lb/> Again, Blackstone concurs with Butler in his argument that God has<lb/> ordered human affairs so that we need only pursue our own happiness to<lb/> find ourselves pursuing the law of nature that God has established for the<lb/> right ordering of our affairs. 219 For both Butler and Blackstone, reasonable<lb/> self-love motivates us to adhere to God&apos;s rule. 220 So here too, Blackstone<lb/> shows himself in the Commentaries aligning with the work of Butler as he<lb/> aligns with other elements of the Anglican tradition.<lb/> Blackstone had every reason to write the Commentaries from an<lb/> Anglican point of view. It was good rhetoric for reaching his intended<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>audience. It was true to his own convictions. We have seen thus far<lb/> particular elements of the Commentaries signaling Blackstone&apos;s Anglican<lb/> approach. The main topic of this article, however, is his use of natural<lb/> law-the concept and body of transcendent law-and the degree to which<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican understanding shapes this use.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. THE ANGLICAN BLACKSTONE AND THE NATURAL LAW<lb/></head>

			<figure type="table">As we have seen, Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries bears the impress of its<lb/> author&apos;s Anglican faith. This impress shapes the appearance of natural<lb/> law in the Commentaries, but by no means minimizes the role of natural<lb/> law. To be sure, if using natural law means using it as Aquinas used it,<lb/> Blackstone does not use natural law. 221 In fact, Anglican Blackstone<lb/> lodges criticism at the scholastic tradition. 222 But the use of natural law, a<lb/> transcendent norm that guides human law, may transcend Aquinas&apos;s use.<lb/> In fact, the Commentaries more than anything takes the common law back<lb/> to natural law, to first principles, 223 portraying the common law as<lb/> blended with the natural law into one body. 224 Its use of natural law is not<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>muddled or unnecessary. <ref type="biblio">225</ref> After its conventional introductory treatment<lb/> of natural law 226 it frequently adverts to natural law principles when<lb/> discussing the common law itself. <ref type="biblio">227</ref> Blackstone held that the natural law<lb/> was the only sure guide to English law. <ref type="biblio">228</ref> Desiring not just to understand<lb/> but also to admire, 229 he sought beauty in the law, a beauty lent to English<lb/> law by God&apos;s design in natural law. <ref type="biblio">230</ref> The Commentaries continuously<lb/> pursues this project and shapes its discussion from principles, <ref type="biblio">231</ref> being<lb/> structured to align positive law with natural law 232 and organized to<lb/> demonstrate order in the English law from divine simplicity. <ref type="biblio">233</ref> While it<lb/> melded law and equity together into one overall, integral system, 234 it<lb/> treated not the whole of the common law, but rather only what was<lb/> susceptible of rational appreciation. <ref type="biblio">235<lb/></ref> The integral connection in the Commentaries between English law<lb/> and natural law constituted English law a handbook on natural law. As the<lb/> spirit of law is a product of natural law, 236 so natural law can be seen from<lb/> the laws of England.</p>

			<figure type="table">237 At the same time, English common law contained<lb/> a strong cultural component, 238 adapted as it was &quot;to the genius of the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> English nation.&quot; 239 Taking liberty as the signal English virtue led, as we<lb/> shall see, only to emphasizing all the more the importance of natural law<lb/> to the laws of England. 240<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Anglican context lent Blackstone&apos;s natural law an empirical<lb/> cast akin to Sir Isaac Newton&apos;s physics. <ref type="biblio">241</ref> His approach was descriptive,<lb/> not deductive. <ref type="biblio">242</ref> Blackstone was not unaware of the dangers of arguing<lb/> from particular to general, 243 but he nonetheless endorsed the scientific<lb/> approach. <ref type="biblio">244</ref> The Commentaries is a quest for reasonableness, for the<lb/> rational principles -the natural law -undergirding the positive<lb/> particulars of English common law. <ref type="biblio">245</ref> Because law is a rational science,<lb/> natural law suffuses the text. <ref type="biblio">246</ref> In this commitment to empirical science<lb/> for fleshing out the natural law embedded in English law, Blackstone<lb/> treats law much as Butler treated theology.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Hooker more than Butler animates Blackstone&apos;s emphasis on<lb/> history, but that emphasis likewise demonstrates an Anglican approach to<lb/> natural law. 247 It is in progressive human experience that Providence<lb/> gradually works the natural law into human law. 248 As with Burke&apos;s view,<lb/> natural law makes itself known in history. 249 But history is no sure<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>guarantee that the human law has taken on its shape from natural law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone held that awkward complexity too comes from history, 250 and<lb/> history must bow to reason if found to contradict it. <ref type="biblio">251</ref> Nevertheless,<lb/> Blackstone held history both descriptive of the law and prescriptive, 252<lb/> obviating the need to distinguish &quot;historical explanation&quot; from &quot;moral<lb/> justification.&quot; <ref type="biblio">253</ref> The providential, historical development of the law<lb/> enabled Blackstone to portray law as possessing both the appropriate<lb/> degree of fixity and the appropriate degree of change. On the one hand,<lb/> common law and justice itself are fixed and uniform. <ref type="biblio">254</ref> On the other<lb/> hand, natural law leads to growth and change in the law, <ref type="biblio">255</ref> and it is<lb/> susceptible of diverse interpretations. <ref type="biblio">256<lb/></ref> Far from his being an<lb/> uncompromising apologist for the status quo, <ref type="biblio">257</ref> Blackstone&apos;s very<lb/> commitment to history also committed him to progress. <ref type="biblio">258</ref> Correction<lb/> and improvement -in continuity with historical development -are<lb/> welcome. <ref type="biblio">259</ref> Accordingly, the Commentaries ends with this charge:<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Nor have it&apos;s [sic; i.e., that of the<lb/> body of English law] faults been concealed from view; for faults<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>To sustain, to repair, to beautify this noble pile, is a charge<lb/> intrusted principally to the nobility, and such gentlemen of the<lb/> kingdom, as are delegated by their country to parliament. The<lb/> protection of THE LIBERTY OF BRITAIN is a duty which they<lb/> owe to themselves, who enjoy it; to their ancestors, who<lb/> transmitted it down; and to their posterity, who will claim at<lb/> their hands this, the best birthright, and noblest inheritance of<lb/> mankind. <ref type="biblio">260<lb/></ref> As the common law embodies and expresses the natural law, it is to be<lb/> reformed when lapses from that transcendent standard appear.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone calls English law of &quot;human structure.&quot;<lb/> Though<lb/> eighteenth-century English lawyers may have called their law &quot;the<lb/> perfection of reason,&quot; <ref type="biblio">261</ref> Blackstone acknowledges it to be a somewhat<lb/> faulty human application of natural law, 262 sometimes more honored in<lb/> the breach. <ref type="biblio">263<lb/></ref> One means of developing the law with both Anglican continuity<lb/> and an eye to the principles of natural law is by legal fiction. <ref type="biblio">264<lb/></ref> Blackstone held that legal fictions permit the law to do justice in changed<lb/> circumstances, 265 as in bypassing Norman errors. <ref type="biblio">266<lb/></ref> In the<lb/></p>

			<p>Commentaries, fictions, along with history, ground the law.</p>

			<figure type="table">267 Legal<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> fictions enable the common law to embody the principles of the natural<lb/> law. 268<lb/> Of course, statutes also might help the law embody the principles<lb/> of natural law. 269 To some degree, the Commentaries portrays statutes as<lb/> declaring the natural law, 270 lending necessary correction to the common<lb/> law while simultaneously rooted in the common law. 271 But statutes<lb/> present a danger:<lb/> THE mischiefs that have arisen to the public from<lb/> inconsiderate alterations in our laws, are too obvious to be<lb/> called in question; and how far they have been owing to the<lb/> defective education of our senators, is a point well worthy of<lb/> the public attention. The common law of England has fared like<lb/> other venerable edifices of antiquity, which rash and<lb/> unexperienced workmen have ventured to new-dress and<lb/> refine, with all the rage of modern improvement. Hence<lb/> frequently it&apos;s [sic] symmetry has been destroyed, it&apos;s [sic]<lb/> proportions distorted, and it&apos;s [sic] majestic simplicity<lb/> exchanged for specious embellishments and fantastic<lb/> novelties. 272<lb/> Architecture was important to Blackstone. 273 As a &quot;rule-bound art,&quot; it<lb/> attracted his keen interest. 274 He used architectural metaphors in the<lb/> Commentaries, 275 and elsewhere portrayed the old common law as a<lb/> well-designed building. 276<lb/> Damning accusation it was, then, for<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>Blackstone to picture some statutes as monstrous add-ons. <ref type="biblio">277</ref> But the<lb/> fault of such statutes is that they are in a sense ahistorical -they reflect<lb/> &quot;visionary schemes&quot; and &quot;have not the foundation of the common law to<lb/> build on.&quot; 278 Statutes that bring the law closer to the natural law will find<lb/> their basis not in imagined exploits but rather in the principles already to<lb/> be found in the common law itself, the generally trustworthy, if<lb/> imperfect, presentation of the natural law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone&apos;s commitment to the common law as holding within it<lb/> immanent natural law reflects both the Roman law and also the Roman<lb/> notion that the jus gentium, the law of nations, is a sound guide to the<lb/> content of the natural law. <ref type="biblio">279</ref> While the common law may embody the<lb/> natural law more perfectly than do other systems of human law, those<lb/> other systems may shed light on the natural law to be found within the<lb/> common law. Blackstone subscribed to the uniformity of human nature<lb/> and God&apos;s purpose, to the consequent uniformity of natural law, and to<lb/> the expectation that the laws of all nations, past and present, would<lb/> reflect these truths. <ref type="biblio">280</ref> Comparative law illuminates the universality of<lb/> English legal principles, the deposit of natural law. <ref type="biblio">281</ref> The Age of Reason<lb/> looked for the natural law in the jus gentium,</p>

			<figure>282 and the Commentaries<lb/> looks to other legal systems to help find reason in the English law. 283 In<lb/> the spirit of Hooker, Blackstone found natural law principles behind the<lb/> diversity of laws even on aspects indifferent under the natural law. And in<lb/> the spirit of Butler, he found marks of reasonableness in the similarity of<lb/> English law to the law of other nations.<lb/> (The dominant role of<lb/> reasonableness in the Commentaries occupies our attention soon.)<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Bible itself often found its way into the Commentaries under the<lb/> aspect of comparative law -again, this was similar to the approach of<lb/> Hooker. <ref type="biblio">284</ref> Blackstone kept the Bible close to him while writing the<lb/> Commentaries, <ref type="biblio">285</ref> and he considered the divine law to be found therein the<lb/> authoritative source on what he called the &quot;law of nature&quot; 286 and on the<lb/> development of legal rules and doctrine. <ref type="biblio">287</ref> Most typically, however, he<lb/> used the Bible as a source of comparative law, a source presenting a body<lb/> of law perfectly devised to embrace the natural law for a specific people at<lb/> a specific time. <ref type="biblio">288</ref> Natural law then was to be found within biblical law<lb/> and not to be identified with it in its particulars. <ref type="biblio">289<lb/></ref> In these diverse ways -from finding natural law embedded within<lb/> the common law, to the use of science, history, and comparative law -<lb/></p>

			<p>the Commentaries takes account of natural law in its treatment of English<lb/> law, all in keeping with an Anglican understanding of natural law and its<lb/> application to human affairs. But the most distinctively Anglican feature<lb/> of how the Commentaries treats the natural law has escaped for the most<lb/> part our attention until now. That feature is the testing and justification<lb/> of the law of England by its reasonableness.</p>

			<figure type="table">Hooker, and especially Butler<lb/> and the Latitudinarians, lent to Anglican theology its distinct emphasis<lb/> on reasonableness. It is in this aspect of his jurisprudence that Blackstone<lb/> most shows himself an Anglican.<lb/> For Blackstone, natural law does not dictate the content of most<lb/> human law. 290 It supplies a few core principles, and those few do not<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> fundamentally overbear human law. 291 Furthermore, the state of civil<lb/> society itself modifies primordial natural law, introducing a context<lb/> where natural law principles take on a different cast or a subservient<lb/> role. 292 For Blackstone, the application of natural law is not so much a<lb/> matter of tracing specific precepts in human law. Rather, it is more like<lb/> the practice of Roman lawyers, finding reasonable and appropriate legal<lb/> norms suited to the situation at hand -the nature of the thing. The<lb/></figure>

			<p>Commentaries presents the common law as a &quot;rational, integrated&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>system, but also consistently traces its reasonableness, the reasons<lb/> behind its details. <ref type="biblio">293<lb/></ref> The quest for life in accordance with nature, and therefore with<lb/> reason, was a mark of the Age of Reason. 294 But Blackstone sought<lb/> reasons for the law as a mark of God&apos;s own perfection, to be discerned<lb/> through human experience. <ref type="biblio">295<lb/></ref> Blackstone derived his passion for<lb/> &quot;reasonableness&quot; in the law, and the consequent searching out of reasons<lb/> for the law, from his Anglican theology. <ref type="biblio">296<lb/></ref> The very core of the<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Commentaries is this essential use of natural law, this examination of<lb/> reasonableness in light of the way things are. Reasons for the law, reasons<lb/> resting upon on fundamental principles, animate the Commentaries. 297<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>Throughout the Commentaries, Blackstone weighs law against the standard<lb/> of reasonableness. <ref type="biblio">298</ref> The weighing is not rigorous.

Not that the particular reason<lb/> of every rule in the law can at this distance of time be always<lb/> precisely assigned; but it is sufficient that there be nothing in<lb/> the rule flatly contradictory to reason, and then the law will<lb/> presume it to be well founded. <ref type="biblio">301<lb/></ref> Most often, however, the Commentaries highlights the place of reason in<lb/> the formulation of the law and supports the reasonableness of its rules. <ref type="biblio">302<lb/></ref> Furthermore, the Commentaries endorses reasonableness in interpreting<lb/> laws according to their equity, reason, and justice. <ref type="biblio">303</ref> This overall<lb/> emphasis on reasonableness in the law, seeking sound reasons for rules<lb/> and for their proper application, largely shapes the Commentaries. <ref type="biblio">304<lb/></ref> Blackstone thought human law most significant on matters<lb/></p>

We already have noticed the emphasis Blackstone placed upon<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> liberty as a mark of English culture. 306 Liberty -personal freedom -is<lb/> so important that only reasonable constraint upon it is licit. 307 &quot;[L]aws<lb/> themselves, whether made with or without our consent, if they regulate<lb/> and constrain our conduct in matters of mere indifference, without any<lb/> good end in view, are laws destructive of our liberty.&quot; 308 Rights therefore<lb/> play a fundamental role in the Commentaries, and help support the natural<lb/> law test of reason even in matters indifferent according to the more<lb/> limited reach of explicit natural law precepts.<lb/> And Blackstone does make much of the notion of matters<lb/> indifferent, a mark of Hooker&apos;s theology and the Anglican tradition. 309<lb/> His frequent use of the test of reasonableness supplies a natural law<lb/> standard in the absence of precise precepts themselves drawn from<lb/> nature. 310 In a sense then, the Commentaries presents most human law as<lb/> prescribing rules for matters indifferent. 311 In another sense, however,<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s insistence upon the reasonableness of human law supplies a<lb/> standard and justification much like that of the Roman law, a standard<lb/> and justification from natural law assuring that human law is suited to<lb/> the reality of things. 312<lb/> The reality of things can become clouded by human artifice, so the<lb/> primitive state -and primitive law -offer a useful corrective. 313 For<lb/> Blackstone, Saxon law stood for law based upon reason, not authority, 314<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>Likewise, Blackstone&apos;s emphasis on the reasonableness of the law<lb/> helps make sense of his theory of judging. A judge is &quot;sworn to determine,<lb/> not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known<lb/> laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but<lb/> to maintain and expound the old one.&quot; 318 This declaratory theory of<lb/> judging has come under wide-ranging attack, 319 and some doubt has been<lb/> cast on whether Blackstone himself really subscribed to it. <ref type="biblio">320</ref> Though<lb/> judges even now may pay lip service to the theory, 321 it may seem unlikely<lb/> that the development of the common law and the decision of difficult<lb/> questions proceed simply from the declaration of pre-existing principles<lb/> and rules, and not from judicial invention. <ref type="biblio">322</ref> But the matter might be less<lb/> puzzling if, rather than thinking that the theory entails some preexistent<lb/> code of natural-law rules ready to fill gaps in the previously declared<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/></ref> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> common law, one could see instead that the question in any case is<lb/> governed either by principles marked in precedent or by whichever of the<lb/> rules proposed by the parties is the more reasonable in the light of<lb/> precedent and the facts of the instant case. <ref type="biblio">323</ref> The judicial resolution of<lb/> otherwise uncertain questions of law demands the application of reason<lb/> and not ex post legislative will.<lb/></p>

			<p>As we have seen, Blackstone does take natural law seriously, but in<lb/> an Anglican sense. The common law reflects the natural law, understood<lb/> as the rule of reasonableness, a norm that aligns the law with the realities<lb/> of the situation at hand, much as the Roman law is celebrated for doing so<lb/> well. That is the natural law as the Commentaries most often applies it.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>After the spread of the Benthamite positivism, the sense of the<lb/> natural law enterprise was forgotten and (despite the eclipse of<lb/> Bentham&apos;s epistemology) it has remained usual to believe that<lb/> the heart of any theory of natural law is, not the problem of the<lb/> varying derivation of positive from natural law, but the thesis<lb/> that positive law is &quot;for all purposes&quot; void if it contradicts<lb/> natural law. Thus Blackstone&apos;s introductory discourse and<lb/> definition of municipal law have standardly been interpreted<lb/> on the assumption that any discussion of the relation between<lb/> natural and positive law must be headed for an assertion or<lb/> denial of that crude slogan, lex iniusta non est lex. <ref type="biblio">324<lb/></ref> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/></ref> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></p>

			<p>Readers of the Commentaries committed to a narrow understanding of<lb/> natural law -often so committed only to reject the concept of natural law<lb/> altogether -find Blackstone at best an epigone of natural law thinkers.<lb/></p>

			<p>He pays his natural-law lip service and then goes about his merry (and<lb/> disguised) positivist way. <ref type="biblio">325</ref> Ignoring the relation of law to morals as well<lb/> as historical normativity, 326 we lack eyes to see Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> natural law in explaining, justifying, and criticizing English law.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the same time, how strange to think that human law somehow<lb/> exists apart from reasons for its existence, reasons that connect it to the<lb/> world it is to govern. Holmes supplies such reasons. <ref type="biblio">327</ref> Posner supplies<lb/> such reasons. <ref type="biblio">328</ref> Blackstone does too. His reasons, his general recursion<lb/> to reasonableness, is not simply a platitudinous reference. Within his<lb/> Anglican context, reason and reasonableness are notes of God&apos;s order and<lb/> providence. They are notes of natural law.<lb/></p>

			<p>The concept of law without values is incoherent. The &quot;reason&quot; and<lb/> &quot;reasonableness&quot; peppering the Commentaries are meant to supply the<lb/> link between the laws of England and the values that developed and<lb/> undergird them. Blackstone&apos;s Anglican approach to systematizing and<lb/> explaining English law -the systematizing and explaining that made his<lb/></p>

			<p>Commentaries such a success -renders this link a natural-law<lb/> enterprise. <ref type="biblio">329</ref> And this enterprise should strike lawyers, and especially<lb/> law students, as something familiar. They may not share Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> theological commitments, but when they strive to make sense of the rules<lb/> of law, to see the rules as reasonable, to find reasons for the rules, they</p>

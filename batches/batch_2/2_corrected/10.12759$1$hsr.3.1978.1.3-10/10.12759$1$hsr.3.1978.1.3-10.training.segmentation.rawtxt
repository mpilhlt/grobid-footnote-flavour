MEDIEVAL HISTORY AND THE COMPUTER IN FRANCE 

French medievalists have displayed an early interest in the 
potentialities of the computer, and Michel Mollat probably de -
serves credit for the first application of the new techniques 
to medieval data in France( 1) . Since then, the National Archives, 
the National Center for Scientific Research (C .N .R .S .) and 
several of its laboratories (notably the Institut de Recherche 
et d ' Histoire des Textes -I .R .H .T . -) and some universities, 
where computing facilities are available, have sponsored the 
development of computer techniques applied to medieval data, 
the specificity of which has rendered the task much more dif-
ficult than it was foreseen . It must be added that close con-
tacts with experimented foreign research centres (such as the 
Centre de Traitement Electronique des Documents Medievaux 
-CETEDOC -at the University of Louvain in Belgium) have some-

times smoothed the way to innovation. 

Medievalists have concentrated their efforts an documentary and 
textual applications of the computer . There are many reasons to 
this situation : lack of satisfying statistical data ready for 
use, and wealth of archives material extremely difficult to 
handle are two prominent reasons . In any case, archives is al -
ways the first problem which the medievalist meets . The National 
Archives are conscious of this fact, and their Service d'Infor-
matique (directed by I . Cloulas) is currently developing a pro-
gram of indexation of the XIA series (the Paris Parliament ar -
chives), offering an easy access to the namesof all persons and 
places mentioned in the process files of the Paris Parliament 
between 1350 and 1363 (2) . 

But useful as it is, this indexation is not a content analysis. 
°A more ambitious project has been elaborated in dose connection 

with the National Archives by the Centre d'Etude d'Histoire 
Juridique, directed by Pierre-Clement Timbal, Mrs . Josette Metman 
being in charge of computer processing . The solution adopted to 
deal with the arrets (sentences) of the Paris Parliament during 
the second half of the fourteenth century has been to build a 
dictionary of concepts summarized by key-words, the thesaurus, 
the content of each document being described only by words bor -
rowed from the thesaurus . Obviously, the thesaurus has been 
built in reference to the source on which the Centre d'Etude 
d'Histoire Juridique is currently working, but it may prove use-. 
ful to students of law history of later medieval France in 
general (3) . On the other hand, it is true that the specificities 
of medieval vocabulary are obscured, hidden behind the updated 

lexicon of key-words, and that the content analysis, precise as 

it is, cannot pretend to be exhaustive, for it remains dependent 
on a selection of facts or concepts : but the programs, derived 
from the documentary SOCRATE system, are highly efficient, and 
this project has already produced appreciated results .

In fact, content analysis proves specially difficult for the 
medievalist, since he can never take for granted the equivalence 
between medieval and modern words . That is why, if we turn our 
attention towards texts in which the technical element is not 
as overwhelming as in juridical sentences, it becomes necessary 
to have recourse to more sophisticated devices than the use of 
a thesaurus( 4 ) . In this field, Mrs . Lucie Fossier and the 
I .R .H .T . have made important contributions in pointing out the 
interest of extracting key-words from the medieval text itself, 
and of taking into account semantic relationships between words 
in recording not only the key-words and their attributes, but 
also syntactic relations between them( 5) . This method gives 
very satisfying results when applied to cartularies and diplom-
atic documents in general, and it is not as heavy and burdensome 
to use as full-text recording is .. 

But for documents with a high literary or lexical interest, it 
remains necessary to record full texts, with all the disadvant-
ages it implies in terms of preparation and Input of the data. 
Being concerned here only with French researches, I shall not 
deal with the programs of the CETEDOC of the University of 
Louvain, though French medievalists have made use of them (6) . 
Mrs . Fossier played an important Part in the birth of one of the 
sections of the Centre de Recherches Appliquees ä la Linguistique 
(C .R .A .L .) at the University of Nancy II : this section is devoted 
to the automatic processing of diplomatic documents of the early 
Middle Ages and is now directed by Michel Parisse e ) . The docu-
ments being usually of small length (charters etc . . .), they are 
recorded in full text . The first task alloted to the Computer 
is to produce a listing in which each line corresponds to one 
word of the original document . It isthen possible to "enrich" 
the text in coding several sorts of informations (diplomatical, 
onomastical, chronological and so on), word by word : these addi-
tions need far less time since punched cards have been dropped 
out, informations being conveyed through a Computer terminal 
with screen and teletype . From the "enriched" text, several 
types of vocabularies and concordances may be obtained : alpha-
betical or chronological dictionaries, frequency tables, ono-
mastical repertories and so on . A systematic publication of the 

results has started already ( 8 ) . 

Convenient for shorter texts, all methods which imply a large 
amount of coding are to be dismissed for Tonger texts, except 
if the historian wants to pay a special attention to philolo-
gical or grammatical problems . Readymade programs for textual 
data and concordances generators are available everywhere, most 
notably in France at the Centre de Lexicologie Politique of the 
Ecole Normale Superieure de Saint-Cloud (9) . But once again, the 
medievalist is heavily penalized by the specificity of his data: 
the total contempt for a regular orthograph which characterizes 
both medieval authors and scribes makes it difficult to use 
standard programs . That is why the Equipe de Traitement automa-
tique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age, working at Paris I under the 

-5 

direction of Bernard Guenee has developed a new concordance 
generator speciall adapted to the difficulties of medieval 
orthograph, ALINE (1o) . It seems possible to combine such an 
approach with more radical documentary processing, since it 
remains impossible to apply full-text recording and process-
ing to large archives series : a full-text processing of a 
sample of documents will allow the extraction of the key-words 
and will help to define the chief concepts ; then the document-
ary processing may take place in better conditions . This solu -
tion is experimented on the JJ series of the National Archives 
(lettres de remission, i .e . letters of pardon) by Mrs . Claude 
Gauvard, with the help of ALINE. 

Documentary treatments are not necessarily based upon existing 
texts . It is also possible to collect and store informations 
and then to ask questions in following syntactic and semantic 
procedures : this requires the elaboration of a . network of connec-
tions 
between the different pieces of information, and, to a 
certain extent, we reach here the fringes of artificial intel -
ligence research . Such a project has been developed by G .P. 
Zarri in order to handle data of miscellaneous origins and 
varied natures gathered by C . Bozzolo on the "love ' court" of 
King Charles VI for the Equipe de Recherche sur L'Humanisme 
Frangais des XIVe et XVe siecles directed by Gilbert Ouy : this 
is a very promising project (11) . 

Statistical methods have not benefited from the Same interest. 
Medieval data with their usual scantiness are puzzling for the 
statistician, since lacunae mar even the best series of data 
and impose the recourse to solutions too sophisticated for the 
value of the results . Besides, no institution comparable to the 
I .R .H .T . or the C .R .A .L . has given the necessary impulse to re -
searches in this field : these researches are usually conducted 
by isolated scholars endowed with only small computing facili-
°ties . One possible exception is the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en 
Sciences Sociales, though its computing centre has attracted 
modern historians (especially demographers) rather than medieval -
ists . It is nevertheless to this centre that we owe what is by 
far the most accomplished work in this category, the study of 
the fiorentine Catasto of 1427 (a franco-american project in 
fact) made by David Herlihy (University of Wisconsin) and Chri -
stiane Klapisch (E .H .E .S .S .) . It is difficult to give a fair 
assessment of their achievement, since only partial results are 
available at the moment (12) . But if they were to be judged from 
their different papers, their results ought to be particularly 
important for demography and social history (population mobil-
ity, repartition of the working men in different trades etc . . .); 
they have had recourse to the most up-to-date methods of factor-
ial analysis, and they have paid special attention to automatic 
mapping .

Large series of archives have often prompted medievalists to 
engage themselves in computerized treatments . Elizabeth Carpen-
tier used the Computer to master the great quantities of infor-
mations contained in the Catasto of Orvieto (13) , whereas 
Mrs . Zerner has tried to adapt her sources (census made in 1414 
for nearly fifty towns and villages of the Comptat Venaissin) 
to the constraints imposed by the Computer upon its users. 
Miss Billot is also interested in urban history and is using 
the OSIRIS package for at least part of her work on the town of 
Chartres in the later Middle Ages ; and Jacqueline Guiral has 
coded and recorded the data she collected in the customs ac-
counts of the harbour of Valencia for the second half of the 
fifteenth century (14) : these two researches are still in Pro-
gress . But results are already on hand for the wills of Lyon in 
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which have been studied 
by Marie-Therese Lorgin (15 ) : these results are a good example 
of what may be achieved by a limited but discriminate treatment 
of such a heterogeneous and bulky source. 

But if sources are not easily available or adaptable, it is 
always possible to build a "metasource" with materials of dif-
ferent origins . This is especially true in the case of prosopo-
graphy and automatic collective biographies, though the border 
between documentary and statistical treatments becomes invisib-
le here . Thanks to a close analysis of the suppliques and 
lettres communes of the Avignonese popes, a group of scholars 
working under the direction of Bernard Guillemain has been able 
to apply documentary techniques to the pontifical archives( 16 ). 
Part of the efforts and time of the Equipe de Traitement Auto-
matique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age has been also devoted to 
automatic prosopography . In the course of her thesis on the 
members of the Paris Parliament in the later Middle Ages, Fran-
Goise Autrand has reconstructed the biographies of 676 indivi-
duals( 17 ) ; and 1 am working myself an a set of 750 english 
historians who lived between 1300 and 1600 : there is a lot of 
classifying, cross-tabulation and indexation to be done on such 
collections, but factorial analysis will also be used (18) since 
it has produced very interesting results in the study of the (19) 
biographies of the canons of Laon made by Mrs . Helene Millet 
The Same course will be followed for the collections of bio-
graphies which are being prepared by Alain Demurger (the baillis 
of the King of France in the fifteenth century) and by Mrs. 
Elisabeth Mornet (Danish clerics with a university education). 
Factorial analysis seems to be a very convenient technique (20) 
for the historian, for it enables him to depict and to summarize 
his documentation, as well as it provides him with a secure 
guidance for interpretation : another successful application of 
factorial analysis to historical data which deserves notice is 
Mrs . Fran9oise Micheau's thesis on translations from the 
arabic (21

Surprisingly enough, fiscal history does not seem to have bene -
fited from the computer potentialities as much as other sectors. 
Nevertheless, a remarkable success has been achieved by Jacques 
Lefort who has been able to discover the rate of taxation em-
ployed in the Byzantine Empire during the fourteenth century by 

comparing several rolls of imposition (praktika) : this is a good 

example of how the computer may,help the historian in bringing . 
to light a part of reality which the traditional historian would 
have thought lost for ever (22) . 

This survey is far from complete (23) . A better idea of what is 
going on among French medievalists interested by quantification 
and computerization will be obtained when the results of the 
inquiry supervised by Lucie Fossier with the help of Christiane 
Klapisch, Jacques Lefort and myself will have found their way to 
the column of Computer and Medieval Data Progressing . The publi-
cation of the reports read at the Rome colloquium in 1975 will 
also provide many new informations on the researches of F .Autrand, 
L. Fossier, Ch . Klapisch, J . Lefort, M . Parisse, J . Verger, 
M. Zerner and many others . But much is still to be done : access 
to machines with good performing capacities remains sometimes 
difficult, especially in provincial universities, and financial 
support is largely inadequate : this is partly due to the fact 
that accounting systems in computing centres have been devised 
to meet the mathematician's or physicist's needs, and are very 
unfavourable to historians who are great consumers of reading 
and printing time, and comparatively small consumers of calculus 
time . But the most important drawback is still the lack of infor-
mation, and even more seriously, the lack of formation of most 
historians : in that respect, if medievalists are not worse than 
their colleagues working on other periods, they are not better . ..

CONFERENCE REPORTS 

THE USE OF QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY 

(ZIF, UNIVERSITY OF BIELEFELD, NOVEMBER 5-6, 1977) 

In their opening adresses Paul J ._Müller from QUANTUM and Franz 
Irsigler (University of Trier) stressed that the conference was 
planned to achieve two goals . First, to overcome the analytieal 
deficiencies and the problems of often faint research questions 
within quantitative history as had already been outlined at the 
earlier ZiF conference in 1976 and proved by the QUANTUM documen-
tation published in 1977 . Second the sections aimed at presenting 
new developments in sociological research which could be applied 
in historical social science too. 

In the section an "Methodological Developments as Foundation for 
a new Encounter between History and Sociology" (chair : Wolfgang 
Sick, QUANTUM) two papers were presented : Theodor Harder (Univer -
sity of Bielefeld) on "Data, Theory, and Model : A Dynamic Per -
spective " , Manfred Küchler (University of Frankfurt) on "Complex 
Data Analysis in Practical Research : Multivariate Analyzing of 
Nominal-Scaled Data " . Theodor Harder gave a paper on theory, data, 
models, and real world . Harder portrayed a wide range of dynamic 
non static models and theories of social science phenomenon . He 
stressed the potentials these new models have for historical pro-
cesses . But these methods have not yet been widely used within 
historical social science . Manfred Küchler presented a 'paper de-
scribing his DIEC-model for analyzing nominal scaled data . This 
approach combines the Goodman and Harder models and makes it 
possible to explain variances in a dependent dichotomous variable 
by the combined effects of more than one dichotomous independent 
variables . In the discussion it was stressed that especially 
historical data are often available only as categorical data and 
that therefore models based on low levels of measurement would be 
very appropriate for historical research . Examples from historical 
research mentioned by the audience made apparent the potentials of 
this kind of data analysis techniques .

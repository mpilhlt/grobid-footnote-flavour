	<bibl><note>the cassation-type model of administrative jurisdiction, administrative courts in principle only investigate the administrative body&apos;s compliance with the law</note>. <title level="a">The main weakness of this adjudication model is that the same case is consecutively heard by administrative authorities and administrative courts (of various instances), without a final decision being issued. However, the stereotype of a court coined in another epoch as a purely cassation-type body must not obscure the challenges of our times. A lot has changed in the world since then, and the ever-growing dependence of the individual on administration (public service) is its visible symptom. Effective protection of the interests of the former now requires the use of more diversified control tools affording a remedy sooner and at a lower cost, and, in specific situations, also allowing administrative courts to decide cases on their merits.

Z. Kmieciak is the head of the Department of Comparative Administrative Procedure at the Faculty of Law and Administration of University of Łódź and a judge of the Supreme Administrative Court</title>. <note>He is also a member of the Committee of Legal Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences and author of over 240 law publications -monographs, workbooks, studies, commentaries, articles, case comments, and reviews</note>.</bibl>
	<bibl><author>| Zbigniew Kmieciak I</author>. <note>One of the four basic requirements considered by the European Committee on Legal Cooperation of the Council of Europe to be an element of the</note> <title level="a">right to judicial control of public administration is affording an effective remedy</title>. <title level="a">Other requirements that the Committee has placed in this group of standards are: 1) an independent and impartial court established by an act of parliament, which reviews at least the lawfulness of the administrative act, 2) a fair hearing within a reasonable time, 3) fair and public proceedings during which the dispute between a natural person and an administrative authority is heard 1 . The list above, reflecting the principles derived by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (ECHR) from Article 6 sec. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (EC), has taken shape through the provisions of the recommendation Rec(2004)20 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States of the Council of Europe on the judicial review of administrative acts. It links the effectiveness of judicial review with the standards of providing the court with appropriate means of redress, including the quashing of the disputed administrative act and referring it back to the administrative authority to take a new decision that complies with the judgement and, where appropriate, decide about compensation and ensure effective e x e c u t i o n of the court&apos;s judgement, in compliance with the Committee&apos;s recommendation Rec(2003)16 on the execution of administrative and judicial decisions in the field of administrative law 2 . According to the second of the recommendations referred to above, the efficiency of judicial review is identified with both, achieving the appropriate result of the review of the act (omission) of an administrative authority and getting to a lawful state of affairs</title>, <note>following a court judgement arising from the lodged plaint.

In a situation that is typical of the Polish system of administrative courts, where a judgment acknowledging the legitimacy of the plaint creates an interim legal situation (effecting the purpose of the review requires a new administrative act) the basic problem is prompt and full execution of the judgment. Only if this condition is met, can we talk about the external efficiency of the review. This should be distinguished from the internal efficiency, associated with satisfying a number of standards of court proceedings, set out by the constitution and conventions ratified by Poland, before the judgment is passed 4 . Judgments of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal do not explicitly treat the efficiency of protection as constituent of the right to have one&apos;s case heard by an independent court</title>, <note>yet -as highlighted in the literature of the subject -it may be seen as derived from one of the constituents of this right, namely the right to appropriate court proceedings 5</note> .</bibl>

This can be illustrated by the powers granted to Dutch administrative courts under Articles 8.72, 8.73 § 4 and 8.86 of the General Administrative Law (Algemene wet bestuursrecht), in force since 1 January 1994. They may, in justified cases in which the disputed act is ex tunc annulled, issue 1) substitute decisions, 2) the so-called accessory judgments on compensation related to the loss caused by the challenged administrative act, and 3) immediate judgments on the merits of the case 6 . The introduction of these measures has been described as furnishing the courts with additional powers of redress, raising no doubts whatsoever about their connection with judicial review commenced by a plaint for annulment of an administrative act 7 . Quite another issue is that the lawmakers of many states have allowed courts reviewing administrative acts to hear and examine evidence to supplement the factual information in the files or to establish relevant facts &quot;from scratch&quot;. Evidence from the testimony of the parties, witnesses and expert witnesses and from visual inspection is provided for, by among of the Consititutional Court&apos;s Case Law</title>], <pubPlace>Łódź</pubPlace>: <publisher>Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego</publisher> <date>2006</date>, pp. <biblScope unit="page">70-71</biblScope>. <note>Representative of the trend is the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of 24.02.2003 (K 28/02) in which it acknowledges that &quot;it is the task of the lawmaker to create a normative situation ensuring not only the right to have one&apos;s case heard by an independent court but also to have its judgment executed</note>&quot;.</bibl>

When administrative jurisdiction was restored in 1980, there was only one measure available to them in response to administrative malfunction or omission -that of s i g n a l l i n g the fact that an administrative act on which the decision had been based was inconsistent with or in breach of the relevant law. The 11 May 1995 -Law on the Supreme Administrative Court 18 introduced a system of sanctions to discipline the administration as a way of ensuring that administrative authorities would perform the duties specified in the course of judicial review or resulting from court judgments.

	<bibl><author>| Zbigniew Kmieciak Administrative</author> Court in Warsaw of 5 <date>August 2010</date> (<ptr type="web">I SA/Wa 38/10</ptr>), &quot;In <title level="m">principle, the administrative court may not take over an administrative matter and decide it directly</title>&quot;. <title level="a">The opinion of this particular court is that Article 154 § 2 of p.a.c., which is an exception to this rule, only applies when instead of an administrative decision or ruling, an act or action concerning the right or obligations ensuing from provisions of the law has been taken</title>. <title level="a">This is a position shared by many representatives of the legal doctrine. Unfortunately, the stipulation discussed here remains &quot;dead&quot; (is hardly used in practice). The judgment issued under Article 146 § 2 of p.a.c. can be classified as a variant of &quot;deciding a case on its merits</title>&quot;. <title level="a">This provision is sporadically applied by administrative courts. Under this article, if the case has been brought not against an administrative decision or ruling, but against an act or action concerning the right or obligations ensuing from provisions of the law (often referred to as physical act), the court in its judgment may acknowledge the legitimacy of such right or obligation. For instance, the judgment of the Regional Administrative Court in Białystok of 26 January 2010 (II SA/Bk 699/09) pronounces the invalidity of the refusal to return part of the fee for the issue of a vehicle ID and recognises the right of the plaintiff to recover the money. In the judgments on identical cases heard by Polish regional administrative courts in Olsztyn -26</title> <date>August 2010</date> (<note>II SA/01 450/09) and in Gdańsk -9</note> <date>September 2010</date> (<note>III SA/Gd 289/10), the invalidity of disputed administrative acts was tied to the acknowledgment of the</note> <title level="a">obligation of the administrative authorities to return the sums unduly charged. The acknowledgment in the judgment quashing an act or pronouncing its invalidity as to the rights or obligations ensuing from provisions of the law may be interpreted as affording the plaintiff an effective remedy by a ruling of a declaratory nature</title>, <note>similar to declaratory judgment in the systems of common law 22 . Using this remedy is meant to describe (confirm as binding) the legal status of the plaintiff, however without direct sanction against the defendant</note> -</bibl>

Sporadic opinions expressing doubts about the wisdom of granting administrative courts the powers (very limited indeed) to decide the case on its merits seem to be evidence of a rigid clinging to the idea that the judiciary and the administration are separate powers. According to S. Jansen, the balance between the two would actually be upset if the judiciary were deprived of a greater influence on the other power. Hence, in his opinion, in order to afford full protection to those who need it, the administrative courts must get more involved in administrative action and engage in effective and conclusive dispute settlement 24</title> .</bibl>
	<bibl><author>VI</author>. <title level="a">While appreciating the importance of the additional, multi-function remedies outlined above, we must remember that the external effectiveness of the judicial control of administration exercised as an action for annulment mainly depends on the mode adopted to settle the dispute, including the formula of judgements and instructions for further action, provided in the written justification of the judgment allowing the complaint. The solutions presented in section (2) above, shaped by the Dutch General Administrative Law, undoubtedly indicate the efforts to harmonise the requirements of cassation-type judgements made by administrative courts with the need to afford an effective remedy to the plaintiff, devoid of excessive burden and respecting the directive on &quot;reasonable time&quot; of the settlement of the dispute, derived from Article 6 sec. 1 of EC.

	<bibl>| <note>Zbigniew Kmieciak to the courts to apply the construction of &quot;administrative loop&quot; (bestuurlijke lus) in some types of disputes. Technically speaking, the use of this construction means that the court issues</note> an interlocutory j u d g m e n t . <title level="s">It has its equivalents in other legal systems, e.g. in France (jugement d&apos;avant dire droit) and in Germany (Zwischenurteil</title>). <title level="a">The issue of an &quot;administrative loop&quot;, or the power to rectify the legality of an administrative decision was considered in detail in the seminar organised by the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union with the collaboration of the Council of State of Belgium</title> (<date>Brussels, 1-2 March 2012</date>). <title level="a">The two following issues were the subject of the seminar as well: 1) power to award compensation and action for annulment, 2) the effectiveness of enforcement of the rulings of administrative courts (power of injunction) 25 . Without going into details of individual varieties of &quot;administrative loop&quot;, we can say that using this measure assumes the suspension of judicial procedure until a competent administrative body submits a modified draft decision taken with due regard to the findings of the court thus far 26 . The interlocutory judgment indicates insofar as possible how to rectify the infringement. In this case, the administrative body must inform the court as soon as possible whether it intends to take up the option, offered by the court, of rectifying the infringement or having it rectified. Where the administrative body accedes to the request to rectify the infringement, it shall indicate in writing as soon as possible how it is going to rectify it. The parties may, within a set period following said written notification being sent, indicate their attitude to rectification of the infringement. A final judgment shall be handed down upon the first appeal against the flawed administrative decision that has been (or has not been) rectified 27 .

It is useful when there is no possibility of making factual findings within judicial procedure (e.g. making calculations relevant for the content of future settlement), as well as the fact that courts are reluctant to interfere with administrative policies 28 . According to G. ten Berge and P. Langbroek, the main advantage of the solution under discussion is the fact that the interlocutory judgment contains &quot;specific instructions&quot; which in a sense determine the scope of lawful acts of an administrative authority, which must take into account the inevitable verification of the draft decision in further judicial review 29 . They also point out that, in the present regulatory environment, an administrative authority can remove any shortcomings of the act in the course of procedures initiated by an appeal (on general terms) lodged with an administrative court only under the institution autorevision provided for in Article 6:18 of the General Administrative Law. In their opinion, the institution of autorevision would be more effective if the impulse for</title> &quot;<note>repair&quot; procedures were instructions given by the court as a result of commencing an &quot;administrative loop&quot; 30 . Also A. J.

I think using this kind of tool should be taken into consideration, particularly in cases whose settlement by public administrative authorities takes a very long time, thus exposing the plaintiffs to inconvenience and hardship, disproportionate to the scale of the problem. Obviously, the question arises whether the legislators (if they appreciate the value of the institution) will dare to give the courts enough discretion to use it. The alternative to this construction would a court order for the competent administrative authority to issue an administrative act of a predefined content (giving specific rights or imposing specific obligations), or even the court&apos;s decision &quot;on the merits&quot; replacing the annulled act. The external efficiency of control exercised by administrative courts according to classic models of cassation decisions is also -as has been mentioned before -a derivative of the way of instructing administrative authorities on further action when a complaint has been allowed. The lengthiness of judgment execution and execution inconsistent with the intent of the court (usually leading to another complaint) do not always have their source in the reluctance to accept the results of the judicial review. They can also result from faulty formulation of legal appraisal and instructions (recommendations) on further proceedings before an administrative authority, contained in the justification of the judgment, and binding -in accordance with Article 153 of p.a.c. -for the court and the authority whose act or omission to act were the subject of the plaint. Certainly, there must be a reason why cassation appeals of administrative authorities against first instance judicial review decisions often make charges about vague, too general, factually inconsistent, or unfeasible recommendations (instructions), or even lack of recommendations in judgment justifications. A survey of the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court provides a number of instances of such errors</title>. <title level="j">Its judgment of</title> <biblScope unit="volume">15</biblScope> <date>July 2010</date> (<idno>II FSK 467/09</idno><title level="a">) states that the lack of recommendations concerning further action merely created &quot;an illusion of efficiency of the review</title>&quot;. <note>In its judgment of</note> <date>10 January 2012</date> (<note>II FSK 1308/10), the Supreme Administrative Court states that the administrative authority is given &quot;conflicting instructions&quot;.

The discussion above makes us aware of the need to debunk certain myths that still persist in some European countries and result from an erroneous understanding of the concept of judicial review of administrative acts (or omissions), and the principle of separation of powers in a Democratic State of Law. The stereotype of a court coined in another epoch as a purely cassation-type body must not obscure the challenges of our times. A lot has changed in the world since then, and the ever-growing dependence of an individual on administration (public service) is its visible symptom.

In this context we should look for an answer to the question of R. Walter: Kassatorische oder reformatorische Entscheidung 35 . In the Polish system of law the administrative courts do not possess the means to rectify a flawed decision similar to the &quot;administrative loop&quot; concept prescribed by Dutch law. The power to quash a decision which gives doubts to its legality is generally considered a sufficient measure of judicial review. Many scholars point out that the present system applicable in Poland is incomplete 36 . It seems that introduction of a means similar to an &quot;administrative loop&quot; would be beneficial in improving the effectiveness of judicial review, especially in &quot;hard cases&quot;. However, there is a certain plan to introduce such measure in the nearest future.

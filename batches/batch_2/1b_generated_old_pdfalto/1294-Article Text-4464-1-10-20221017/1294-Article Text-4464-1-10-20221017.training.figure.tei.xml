            <figDesc>almost two-hour-long Westminster Hall Debate in which members failed to reference any<lb/> of these obligations. 26<lb/> Domestic legislation involving PLE has also been threadbare. The most compelling<lb/> provision is s1(g) of the Legal Services Act 2007 (LSA 2007) which imposes an obligation<lb/> upon the Legal Services Board (LSB) to &quot;increasing public understanding of the citizen&apos;s<lb/> legal rights and duties.&quot;<lb/> Though the placement of this obligation in statute is novel, and of relevance to the current<lb/> discussion it is deficient in several respects. Put simply, imposing the obligation on the<lb/> LSB doesn&apos;t guarantee any PLE activity. Legal professionals are not best placed to<lb/> provide such an onerous duty alongside their core role, representing clients. The LSB<lb/> itself is not a &apos;front-line regulator&apos; but instead a &apos;regulator of regulators&apos; in essence acting<lb/> through regulators such as the Bar Standards Board and Solicitors Regulatory Authority<lb/> to influence lawyers. This means that the LSB has made a modest number of PLE<lb/> interventions (such as running the collaborative &apos;Justice Week&apos; campaign) and the impact<lb/> of the LSA 2007 has been limited in respect of legal capability.<lb/> 26 HC Deb 15 May 2018, vol 641 col 80WH<lb/> 38<lb/> LSB Justice Week Events<lb/> The most authoritative and influential obligation to deliver PLE is the framework<lb/> surrounding the Education Act 2002. S78 of the Act states that maintained schools should<lb/> provide a &apos;balanced and broadly based curriculum&apos; which &apos;promotes the spiritual, moral,<lb/> cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society&apos;. This<lb/> obligation would go on to be known as &apos;SMSC&apos; by the teaching profession. The<lb/> Department for Education modified this requirement in September 2014 to require SMSC<lb/> to include promotion of the &apos;Fundamental British Values&apos;. These &apos;FBVs&apos; comprise:<lb/> 1. democracy,<lb/> 2. the rule of law,<lb/> 3. individual liberty and<lb/> 4. mutual respect and tolerance for those of different and no faiths.</figDesc>

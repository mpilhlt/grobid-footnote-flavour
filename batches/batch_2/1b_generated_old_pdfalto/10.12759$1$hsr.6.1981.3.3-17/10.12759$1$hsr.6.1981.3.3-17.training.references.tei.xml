The study of demographic history in the United States has come a long way since its emergence in the mid-1960s . It was really only then that American scholars of European and United States history first began to ask the kinds of questions that were of concern to French and British demographic historians, and to apply the techniques for demographic historical analysis that they had de-veloped .(1) In the spring of 1968, the editors of Daedalus</note>, a &apos; journal published by the <title level="s">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</title>, <note>published a collection of articles on the theme of</note> &quot;<title level="m">Historical Population Studies&quot; as a means of introducing the American scholarly community to this relatively new body of research</title> . <title level="a">Only about half of the authors represented in the collection were from the United States, and it is fair to say that none of their studies could truly be characterized as demographic history</title> . <title level="a">These largely ten-tative and exploratory essays represented rather a first attempt to define some problem areas and to carve out a place for de-mographic study in the emergent field of social history</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">2</biblScope>) <title level="a">From this modest and recent beginning, the study of demographic history in the United States has expanded dramatically</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">3</biblScope>) <title level="a">Any effort brief-ly to characterize so lively a field is bound to be fragmentary . The essay which follows is an attempt to look at the evolution of, and some current directions in, research on a few clusters of central problems . The works discussed have been selected as exemplary of the field ; no attempt will be made to be exhaustive in covering the numerous and quite diverse collection of historical demographic works which have been published by American scholars.

In <title level="m">particular, the pioneering works of John Demos(5)</title>, <title level="a">Kenneth Lockridge(6), and Phillip Greven(7) first integrated a demographic analysis into the historical portrayal of daily life and social in-stitutions in New World communities</title> . <title level="a">In discussing these early explor-ations, Lockridge would later maintain that they showed that the transatlantic migrations did not transform &apos;the European peasant&apos; in terms of essential behaviors and attitudes(8) (one wonders what he meant by this since colonial New England was not populated by &apos;peasants&apos; as the term is usually meant!)</title> . <title level="a">These early studies none-theless uncovered some apparent striking demographic contrasts bet-ween the Old World and the New : higher completed fertility in the colonies, more youthful female marriage, lower infant mortality, greater longevity</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">9</biblScope>) (<title level="a">A slightly later study by Daniel Scott Smith actually directly compared Swedish records with those of a New England community, using techniques which allowed the analysis of the various components of population growth . Smith found levels of marital fertility that were comparable, and was thus able to attribute the faster population growth rate in the colonies to higher levels of nuptiality and lower mortality(1O)</title> . <title level="a">These early studies, restricted as they were to data from individual communities, employing for the most part only descriptive statistics, often re-sorting to dubious methods and corrective measures, nonetheless isolated important demographic questions, questions which have re-mained central to demographic and social historical analysis as it has reached into other regions of the United States, and other periods of American history . These problem areas include : the re-lationships between economic opportunity, especially in the form of landholding, and demographic patterns ; changing family and community life under the impact of immigration and rapid population growth ; changes in demographic behavior and attitudes between first generation migrants and their descendants. The relationship between family processes and land inheritance patterns has been as important for the demographic history of the United States as it has been in Europe . Naturally, the greater availability of land in frontier regions and the lesser communal control over its disposal made it seem likely to researchers that the demographic consequences would be somewhat different from the European pattern . In fact, U .S . frontier areas have served as a sort of historical laboratory for social scientists interested, in particular, in the connections between land availability and fertility . Best known of these is Richard Easterlin, an economist whose hypotheses about economic determinants of family size have been tested historically in frontier areas</title> . <title level="a">Easterlin&apos;s early works(11) laid out his model . More recent empirical studies based largely on multivariate analysis from U .S . and state census ma-terials have begun to examine the relationship between changing farm conditions and rural fertility patterns in the United States in the late 19th century(12)</title> . <title level="a">Similar methods and models have been used in studies like those of John Modell or Peter Lindert(13), studies which help to account for general and differential trends in the fertility decline which occurred in the U .S . beginning in the 19th century . A more recent project entitled &quot;Family Strategy in the Upper Midwest</title>&quot;, under the direction of <editor>Russell Menard,</editor> <title level="a">will -5 -examine the impact on fertility strategies in rural northern Minnesota and Wisconsin of economic developments like commercial agriculture and mining industry</title> . <title level="a">Like many of the more recent analyses of demographic change in the United States, the Upper Midwest Fertility Project employs a life-course perspective in its analysis of Federal and state census materials, and uses mul-tivariate techniques to test hypotheses about relationships bet-ween economic and demographic change .(14) The analysis of fertility patterns in largely economic terms has met with criticism from a variety of perspectives . For example, proponents of modernization theory like Maris Vinovskis argue that socio-economic variables, while important, are not adequate to account for what was, after all, a general pattern of fertility decline . Vinovskis would like to take attitudinal components of change more seriously, and some of the support for arguments of this sort is drawn from ethnic differentials in fertility patterns in urban and rural areas of the U .S .(15) The demographic study of urban populations as such has often come out of the field of urban history rather than economics, and where it has, is better integrated into the study of social historical context than is often the case with the frontier studies .(16) The study of the family in the urban American context is providing valuable insights into the institution which is, of course, the key to understanding demographic behavior . While there are numerous examples of individual and small group projects concerned with urban social, family and demographic history, it is worth noting especially here the most exciting and promising of these -the Philadelphia Social History Project .(17) This project, housed at the School of Public and Urban Policy of the University of Pennsylvania and headed by Theodore Hershberg, employs a fulltime interdisciplinary staff as well as a large number of temporary research associates for specific areas of expertise . The research associates are en-gaged in genuinely interdisciplinary and collaborative work employ-ing an enormous common data base including manuscript censuses, house-hold surveys, manufacturing censuses, business directories and mort-ality registers for the city of Philadelphia, all of which have been converted to a machine-readable format . Perhaps more than any other social historical project currently underway, the Philadelphia Pro-ject allows and encourages a &quot;total history&quot; to be undertaken -one which links developments in demographic, family, labor and community history together in the context of an understanding of the evolution of the urban space itself .(18) There is one other area of American history for which explicit links between economic and demographic trends have been much the focus of study -the field of Afro-American history, both under slavery and after Emancipation . Many of the questions and controversies current-ly surrounding antebellum black demographic history trace their origins to the arguments made by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman in. Time on the Cross : the Economics of American Negro Slavery .(19) Although there had been a number of earlier studies of black demo-graphy and demographic history(20), it is fair to say that it was Fogel and Engerman&apos;s study that really set the field in motion, and has largely structured its subsequent debates . Their argument, -6 -centering as it does on an effort to prove that slavery was a pro-fitable (and hence economically rational) system, focussed attention on such essentially demographic issues as the viability of the slave labor force and its ability to reproduce itself as a labor supply. Although Time of the Cross has been rightfully criticized for its conceptualization (especially for its attempts to compare regional economies and labor conditions in different sections of the U .S .) and for its sometimes dubious methodology (for example, its heroic .assumptions and overgeneralizations from sparse data), subsequent less grandiose and more careful researchers have felt compelled to address the important questions raised by Fogel and Engerman . Re-cent special issues of Southern Studies(21) and The William and Mary Quarterly(22) attest to the strides made toward uncovering new sources and establishing methods for their analysis which will yield more precise estimates of slave population trends, even for the colonial era . The relatively recent study of slave demography in the colonial era is of particular importance, since many significant changes in black population patterns apparently occurred before usable census records are available . Generally cited as models of correct methodology, the articles of Russell Menard and his col-leagues on the Chesapeake Project sponsored by the St .Mary&apos;s City Commission are interesting for their blend of economic, demographic and social historical evidence drawn mainly from probate records(23). Analyses of the records of individual plantations have also pro-duced credible demographic evidence when carefully handled as, for example</title>, in articles by <editor>James Trussell and Richard Steckel</editor>(<biblScope unit="issue">24</biblScope>), <publisher>Alan Kulikoff</publisher>(<biblScope unit="issue">25</biblScope>), and <orgName type="collaboration">Cheryll Cody .</orgName><title level="a">(26) Mention should also be made of the influential work of Herbert Gutman(27), whose search for new sources to aid in a reconstruction of black family patterns and family culture has been generally well-received . Gutman has been criticized, however, for his failure to employ systematic demographic methods and concepts even where they are, in fact, crucial to support his argument maintaining the viability and resilience of Afro-American family systems . His goal -to counter both the older sociological portrait of the American black family popularized by the Moynihan report(28), and the relatively sanguine picture of slave family life which one might draw from Time on the Cross -is certainly worth pursuing with utmust rigor .(29) A whole set of characteristically American historical problem areas -frontier society, immigration, slavery -have thus been much illuminated, if not redefined by the introduction of a historical demographic perspective</title> . <note>But these remain &quot;American&quot; problems -despite their obvious methodological indebtedness to European scholars, it is fair to say that most historians of the U .S . con-duct their research in relative isolation from European histor-ians .(30</note>) <title level="a">This is naturally not the case with American demographic historians of Europe, whose research is closely linked both theoretically and methodologically with that of European colleagues, and is in some cases absolutely central to the fields. One of the earliest and best known projects involving European demo-graphic history is the European Fertility Project headed by Ansley Coale of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. The demographers associated with the Project have set for themselves the goal of</title> &quot;<note>recording the decline of fertility in each of the provinces of Europe . . . from the time in each province when marital -7 -fertility was essentially constant until it reached a minimum or until the present, if it is still declining&quot;(31) . The group has produced a large number of articles and a series of monographs describing the demographic transition in different regions of re-search .(32) An important by-product of the Project has been the creation of a series of indexes of fertility and nuptiality which can be constructed from the kinds of data often available histor-ically, and sets of model life tables which have been widely used by demographic historians . Theoretically, the works restrict themselves to a search for the relationships between fertility decline and socio-economic change suggested by the loosely specified &quot;demographic transition theory&quot; . But the empirical results are not particularly supportive of generalization along these lines . As one recent reviewer put it, &quot;we still have the old &apos;theory&apos; with little predictive power . We now perhaps realize (as a result of the EFP studies) even more firmly that the transition is really a collection of variant patterns of fertility and nuptiality change and that the relationships between demographic and socio-economic variables are not constant or even very predictable in shape and magnitude .&quot;(33</note>)</bibl>
	<bibl><title level="m">The OPR studies of published census materials are by no means the only types of research undertaken by American demographic histor-ians of Europe</title> . <title level="a">Many are working with community--level sources like parish registers and household surveys, exploring the process of demographic change in a fashion not possible through the analysis of aggregate data alone</title> . <note>Much of the theoretical interest of American historians, like that of their European colleagues, has centered on the demographic character of the peasant community and its eventual alteration under the impact of historical change</note>. <title level="m">The demographer John Knodel</title>, <note>in fact one of the associates on the European Fertility Project</note>, <title level="a">has also worked extensively with a set of German village geneologies, the Ortssippenbücher, to des-cribe what he finds to be essentially a &apos;natural fertility&apos; re-gime throughout rural Germany until well into the 19th century</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">34</biblScope>) <title level="a">Since he is a demographer, Knodel pays relatively little attention to the social-historical context of the populations he studies, but his precise and careful demographic analysis of them represents a great contribution to our understanding of central European histor-ical demographic patterns</title>. <title level="a">Social historians concerned with demographic questions have tended to pay more attention to context, and have attempted to enmesh de-mographic behavior in the system of social relationships in which it occurred . David Sabean, for example, has undertaken a massive effort to write a &apos;total history&apos; of a set of South German commun-ities from the 16th through the 19th centuries . He hopes to account for important longterm changes in demographic behavior as part of a complex evolution involving farming practices, settlement patterns, inheritance and land tenure practices and market relations . Sabean, in his earlier work on the era of the Peasant War, has illustrated how much a demographic perspective can add to the analysis of long-standing social-historical problems .(35) The connections between the demography, family life and household structure of the peasant community, on the one hand, and land tenure and inheritance patterns, on the other, have also been explored in the seminal work of Lutz -8 -Berkner</title> . <title level="a">Ranging in area from central France through Germany and Austria, Berkner&apos;s research has illustrated the persistence of &quot;stem&quot; family structures and other strategies for handling the difficulties inherent in the effort to balance land and population in the peasant system . Berkner has also illustrated how inheritance customs can affect population growth</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">36</biblScope>) <title level="a">Andreas Plakans has come to consistent conclusions about land tenure and household structure in his studies in the Baltic area, work which suggests a connection between the complex household system common to that area and the labor demands made by landlords as part of the condition of tenure .(37) One of the central debates surrounding the historical (and contempo-rary) analysis of economic development and population change con-cerns the origin and nature of the population rise associated with the early stages of transition to industrial capitalism . The de-mographic transition theory mentioned above certainly offers one account -in simplest terms, changes associated with &apos;modernization&apos; (health care, education etc .) bring about lowered mortality, which in turn encourages adjustments in fertility . An alternative theoretical tradition, one more sceptical of the supposed bene-ficial consequences of economic modernization, emphasizes instead the destabilizing impact of early capitalist intervention into the peasant economy, and the demographic imbalances created through the earlier marriage and higher fertility associated with it . This approach pushes researchers back in time, into the early modern &apos;proto-industrial&apos; phase of economic growth . Again, the work of American researchers has been critical to the debate .(38) The work of Franklin Mendels, an economic historian who compared patterns of development in commercial agricultural and proto-industrial re-gions of Flanders, first illustrated the demographic effect of rural industry</title> .(<biblScope unit="volume">39</biblScope>) <title level="m">Other American economic historians, notably Herbert Kisch and Richard Rudolph, have followed the route of rural industrial development in Central Europe and Russia</title> .(<biblScope unit="volume">40</biblScope>) <title level="a">Certainly much work needs to be done to make the case, but future discussion of demographic change in rural Europe will need to take these find-ings into account and to expand upon them</title>. <title level="a">American scholars have also been active in the area of European urban demographic history, perhaps even more active than their European colleagues . A few examples will serve to illustrate the scope and results of their research . David Herlihy&apos;s work on Renaissance Florence(41) has been rightfully called &quot;the most successful effort so far to integrate demographic analysis with regional social history and literary sources</title> .&quot;(<biblScope unit="issue">42</biblScope>) <title level="a">Allan Sharlin&apos;s study of early modern Frankfurt combines the mastery of historical sources with awareness of appropriate methods of analysis so crucial to high quality demographic history .(43) Louise Tilly&apos;s current research about women&apos;s work, family strategies and de-mographic patterns in several northern French cities promises to add as much to the field of urban demographic history as her earlier collaborative work with Joan Scott added to the field of European family and women&apos;s history .(44) James Jackson&apos;s social and demographic analysis of industrial Duisburg has illustrated the rich possibilities open to those willing to explore sources like migration records, sources which illuminate the demographic patterns and family experiences associated with early industrial urban--9 -ization .(45) Urban-rural comparisons from analyses of published census statistics by Michael Haines(46) and John Knodel and Mary Jo Maynes(47), call into question some pervasive assumptions about the demographic history of the nineteenth-century, especially about the demographic behavior of &apos;modern&apos; sectors . The results of these various studies are by no means entirely consistent and these new empirical contributions leave many theoretical questions unresolved. But, as in the case of U .S . urban demographic history, the mesh of theoretical concern, generally careful methodology, and creative use of sources represented by the best of these studies, makes American work in the field of European urban social and demographic history especially significant. No essay about the study of demographic history in the United States would be complete without some mention of the handful of social scientists who have, often in addition to their empirical work, furthered the field through conceptual and theoretical writings, critical discussions and evaluations of historical demographic li-terature and methodological advances . Charles Tilly&apos;s main empirical concern with demography centers on the question of the components of the process of proletarianization, but he has, in a few important essays, also synthesized large bodies of social and demographic historical writing and suggested hypotheses about demographic change</title> <note>which have served as guideposts for others engaged in research .(48) The &apos;neo-Malthusian &apos; economist Ron Lee has developed techniques for improving the nature of information derived from aggregative analysis of parish registers, especially spectral analysis for use in de-tecting cycles in demographic trends and in their relationships to other series data .(49) Allan Sharlin is establishing himself as one of the foremost U .S . students and proponents of sound historical demographic techniques, and has contributed methodologically and conceptually to some specific research problem areas.(50) Daniel</note></bibl>
	<bibl><author>Scott Smith</author>(<biblScope unit="issue">51</biblScope>), <title level="m">Maris Vinovskis(52)</title><author>, and Lutz Berkner</author>(<biblScope unit="issue">53</biblScope>), <title level="m">have all written thoughtful assessments and critical evaluations of sub-stantial bodies of historical demographic literature, essays which have helped to point out difficulties in published research, and to improve the designs and techniques of later studies</title> . <note>Berkner has also been important in the development of a process-oriented</note>, or life-cycle perspective on family history . <title level="a">He originally pre-sented his thoughts on this subject in his analysis of Austrian peasant households and in his criticism of the work of Peter Laslett and associates</title> .(<biblScope unit="issue">54</biblScope>) <title level="a">The life-cycle perspective has also become cen-tral to the conceptualization of demographic problems characteristic of many social historians of the U .S . like Tamara Hareven and her associates, who draw some of their inspiration from American sociologists of the family(55), and help to integrate some of their insights into historical work. Part of the explanation for the strides made in and more central role of historical demographic study in the United States (even . though the persistence of problems in the field and resistance in some circles to its acceptance cannot be denied) is the emergence of a number of centers where group projects are in progress, where training of students in historical demographic techniques takes place, or where concentrations of individual researchers are large enough to establish an intellectual atmosphere conducive to this -10 -type of work . The most active of these centers are probably the Office of Population Research of Princeton University (home of the European Fertility Project)</title>, <title level="a">The Population Studies Center of the University of Pennsylvania (some of whose members are affiliated with the Philadelphia Social History Project), the Population Studies Center of the University of Michigan, the Center for Histor-ical Population Studies of the University of Utah, and the Newberry Library in Chicago . The Utah Center is the only one in the U .S. founded with the express aim of promoting research in historical population studies ; the other demographic centers mentioned encourage historical projects along with a variety of other types of demo-graphic analysis . The prime function to date of the Center for Historical Population Studies has been to facilitate scholarly access to the mammoth collection of demographic records collected in the archives of the Geneological Society of Utah .(56) Re-seatchers have already begun to find these collections useful, and a number of projects have been undertaken to exploit them -for example, the Mormon Demography Project which is examining patterns of marriage, fertility, mortality and migration among Utah Mormons over the last 125 years ;(57) and a project entitled</title> &quot;<title level="j">The Economics of Mortality in North America</title>, <idno>1650-1910</idno>&quot;(<biblScope unit="volume">58</biblScope>), <title level="a">which is assembling a data base of census, geneological, probate and tax records for a proposed examination of regional and ethnic mortality differentials, and associations between socio-economic variables and mortality . The role of the Family and Community History Center of the Newberry Library is somewhat different. This Center is particularly important as a training grounds for social historians -the annual Summer Institutes in Quantitative History provide training in statistics, research design, com puting, demography and family history in addition to workshops on a variety of social historical topics . The Library also has a good collection of source materials including geneologies and local histories for American and English communities, and provides some fellowship support for scholars working with these sources . Current research projects include Daniel Scott Smith&apos;s study of the older population of the United States(S9) and Barbara Hanawalt&apos;s study of the late medieval peasant family in England . The Library also houses the Center for the History of the American Indian, which has began to support a small number of demographic projects. Perhaps even more encouraging is the fact that most major departments of history now feel obliged to have on their staff at least one historian with demographic training or research interests . Thus even where no formal training in demographic historical methods is offered, the perspective is nonetheless available to students . Some departments, those of Michigan and Minnesota, for example, have by design or chance even assembled clusters of scholars engaged in research on family and demographic history . These examples are certainly atypical, but it is safe to say that, current university budgetary crises and hiring freezes notwithstanding, demographic historians have managed to establish themselves in academe</title>, <note>and to incorporate their perspective into many of the major intellectual debates of contemporary American historical and social scientific disciplines -an impressive record for a first generation . -11 -ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author wishes to thank Cheryll Cody, Mike Frisch, Harvey Graff, Dean May, Rus Menard, John Modell and Henry Williams for their help in informing me about historical demographic projects in which they are currently involved and about their areas of research.

            <table>published a study reflecting the views of 63 participants<lb/> in Street Law projects from multiple jurisdictions. Their study revealed five key<lb/> themes in student self-identified learning: explaining legal topics to lay audiences,<lb/> public speaking in a non-academic setting, building substantive legal content,<lb/> research and preparation and developing cultural competency and community<lb/> connections. </table>
 
            <figDesc>The research highlighted the adaptation of lesson plans in Street Law,<lb/> but there was no further evidence that adapting resources was seen or viewed as a<lb/> skill by the students. Further, in many other research papers on student skills<lb/> development from both clinical legal education and more specifically Street Law; the<lb/> ability to adapt, develop and edit other people&apos;s work is rarely, if not ever, recognised.</figDesc>

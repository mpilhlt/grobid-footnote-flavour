	<bibl><note>French medievalists have displayed an early interest in the potentialities of the computer, and Michel Mollat probably de -serves credit for the first application of the new techniques to medieval data in France( 1) . Since then, the National Archives, the</note> <publisher>National Center for Scientific Research (C .N .R .S .) and several of its laboratories</publisher> (notably the Institut de <title level="s">Recherche et d &apos; Histoire des Textes</title> -<author>I .R .H .T</author> . -) <note>and some universities, where computing facilities are available, have sponsored the development of computer techniques applied to medieval data, the specificity of which has rendered the task much more dif-ficult than it was foreseen</note> . <note>It must be added that close con-tacts with experimented foreign research centres (such as the Centre de Traitement Electronique des Documents Medievaux -CETEDOC</note> -at the <title level="a">University of Louvain in Belgium) have some-times smoothed the way to innovation</title>. <title level="a">Medievalists have concentrated their efforts an documentary and textual applications of the computer</title> . <title level="a">There are many reasons to this situation : lack of satisfying statistical data ready for use, and wealth of archives material extremely difficult to handle are two prominent reasons</title> . <title level="s">In any case, archives is al -ways the first problem which the medievalist meets . The National Archives are conscious of this fact, and their Service d&apos;Infor-matique</title> (directed by <author>I . Cloulas</author>) <title level="a">is currently developing a pro-gram of indexation of the XIA series (the Paris Parliament ar -chives), offering an easy access to the namesof all persons and places mentioned in the process files of the Paris Parliament between 1350 and 1363 (2)</title> . <title level="a">But useful as it is, this indexation is not a content analysis. °A more ambitious project has been elaborated in dose connection with the National Archives by the Centre d&apos;Etude d&apos;Histoire Juridique</title>, directed by <editor>Pierre-Clement Timbal, Mrs</editor> . <title level="a">Josette Metman being in charge of computer processing . The solution adopted to deal with the arrets (sentences) of the Paris Parliament during the second half of the fourteenth century has been to build a dictionary of concepts summarized by key-words, the thesaurus, the content of each document being described only by words bor -rowed from the thesaurus . Obviously, the thesaurus has been built in reference to the source on which the Centre d&apos;Etude d&apos;Histoire Juridique is currently working, but it may prove use-. ful to students of law history of later medieval France in general (3)</title> . <title level="a">On the other hand, it is true that the specificities of medieval vocabulary are obscured, hidden behind the updated lexicon of key-words, and that the content analysis, precise as it is, cannot pretend to be exhaustive, for it remains dependent on a selection of facts or concepts : but the programs, derived from the documentary SOCRATE system, are highly efficient, and this project has already produced appreciated results . -4 -In fact, content analysis proves specially difficult for the medievalist, since he can never take for granted the equivalence between medieval and modern words</title> . <title level="a">That is why, if we turn our attention towards texts in which the technical element is not as overwhelming as in juridical sentences, it becomes necessary to have recourse to more sophisticated devices than the use of a thesaurus( 4 )</title> . <title level="a">In this field, Mrs . Lucie Fossier and the I .R .H .T . have made important contributions in pointing out the interest of extracting key-words from the medieval text itself, and of taking into account semantic relationships between words in recording not only the key-words and their attributes, but also syntactic relations between them( 5)</title> . <title level="a">This method gives very satisfying results when applied to cartularies and diplom-atic documents in general, and it is not as heavy and burdensome to use as full-text recording is</title> .. <title level="a">But for documents with a high literary or lexical interest, it remains necessary to record full texts, with all the disadvant-ages it implies in terms of preparation and Input of the data. Being concerned here only with French researches, I shall not deal with the programs of the CETEDOC of the University of Louvain, though French medievalists have made use of them (6) . Mrs . Fossier played an important Part in the birth of one of the sections of the Centre de Recherches Appliquees ä la Linguistique (C .R .A .L .) at the University of Nancy II : this section is devoted to the automatic processing of diplomatic documents of the early Middle Ages and is now directed by Michel Parisse e ) . The docu-ments being usually of small length (charters etc . . .), they are recorded in full text . The first task alloted to the Computer is to produce a listing in which each line corresponds to one word of the original document . It isthen possible to &quot;enrich&quot; the text in coding several sorts of informations (diplomatical, onomastical, chronological and so on), word by word : these addi-tions need far less time since punched cards have been dropped out, informations being conveyed through a Computer terminal with screen and teletype . From the &quot;enriched&quot; text, several types of vocabularies and concordances may be obtained : alpha-betical or chronological dictionaries, frequency tables, ono-mastical repertories and so on . A systematic publication of the results has started already ( 8 )</title> . <title level="a">Convenient for shorter texts, all methods which imply a large amount of coding are to be dismissed for Tonger texts, except if the historian wants to pay a special attention to philolo-gical or grammatical problems . Readymade programs for textual data and concordances generators are available everywhere</title>, <note>most notably in France at the Centre de Lexicologie Politique of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Saint-Cloud</note> (<biblScope unit="issue">9</biblScope>) . <title level="a">But once again, the medievalist is heavily penalized by the specificity of his data: the total contempt for a regular orthograph which characterizes both medieval authors and scribes makes it difficult to use standard programs . That is why the Equipe de Traitement automa-tique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age, working at Paris I under the -5 direction of Bernard Guenee has developed a new concordance generator speciall adapted to the difficulties of medieval orthograph, ALINE (1o) . It seems possible to combine such an approach with more radical documentary processing, since it remains impossible to apply full-text recording and process-ing to large archives series : a full-text processing of a sample of documents will allow the extraction of the key-words and will help to define the chief concepts ; then the document-ary processing may take place in better conditions . This solu -tion is experimented on the JJ series of the National Archives (lettres de remission, i .e . letters of pardon) by Mrs . Claude Gauvard, with the help of ALINE. Documentary treatments are not necessarily based upon existing texts . It is also possible to collect and store informations and then to ask questions in following syntactic and semantic procedures : this requires the elaboration of a . network of connec-tions between the different pieces of information, and, to a certain extent, we reach here the fringes of artificial intel -ligence research . Such a project has been developed by G .P. Zarri in order to handle data of miscellaneous origins and varied natures gathered by C . Bozzolo on the &quot;love &apos; court&quot; of King Charles VI for the Equipe de Recherche sur L&apos;Humanisme Frangais des XIVe et XVe siecles directed by Gilbert Ouy : this is a very promising project (11) . Statistical methods have not benefited from the Same interest. Medieval data with their usual scantiness are puzzling for the statistician, since lacunae mar even the best series of data and impose the recourse to solutions too sophisticated for the value of the results . Besides, no institution comparable to the I .R .H .T . or the C .R .A .L . has given the necessary impulse to re -searches in this field : these researches are usually conducted by isolated scholars endowed with only small computing facili-°ties</title> . <note>One possible exception is the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, though its computing centre has attracted modern historians (especially demographers) rather than medieval -ists</note> . <note>It is nevertheless to this centre that we owe what is by far the most accomplished work in this category, the study of the fiorentine Catasto of 1427 (a franco-american project in fact) made by David Herlihy (University of Wisconsin) and Chri -stiane Klapisch (E .H .E .S .S .</note>) . <note>It is difficult to give a fair assessment of their achievement, since only partial results are available at the moment (12) . But if they were to be judged from their different papers, their results ought to be particularly important for demography and social history (population mobil-ity, repartition of the working men in different trades etc .</note> . .);</bibl>
	<bibl><note>they have had recourse to the most up-to-date methods of factor-ial analysis, and they have paid special attention to automatic mapping . -6 -Large series of archives have often prompted medievalists to engage themselves in computerized treatments . Elizabeth Carpen-tier used the Computer to master the great quantities of infor-mations contained in the Catasto of Orvieto</note> (<biblScope unit="issue">13</biblScope>) , <title level="m">whereas Mrs</title> . <title level="a">Zerner has tried to adapt her sources (census made in 1414 for nearly fifty towns and villages of the Comptat Venaissin) to the constraints imposed by the Computer upon its users. Miss Billot is also interested in urban history and is using the OSIRIS package for at least part of her work on the town of Chartres in the later Middle Ages ; and Jacqueline Guiral has coded and recorded the data she collected in the customs ac-counts of the harbour of Valencia for the second half of the fifteenth century (14) : these two researches are still in Pro-gress</title> . <title level="a">But results are already on hand for the wills of Lyon in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries which have been studied by Marie-Therese Lorgin (15 ) : these results are a good example of what may be achieved by a limited but discriminate treatment of such a heterogeneous and bulky source</title>. <title level="a">But if sources are not easily available or adaptable, it is always possible to build a &quot;metasource&quot; with materials of dif-ferent origins . This is especially true in the case of prosopo-graphy and automatic collective biographies, though the border between documentary and statistical treatments becomes invisib-le here . Thanks to a close analysis of the suppliques and lettres communes of the Avignonese popes, a group of scholars working under the direction of Bernard Guillemain has been able to apply documentary techniques to the pontifical archives</title>( <biblScope unit="issue">16</biblScope> ). <title level="a">Part of the efforts and time of the Equipe de Traitement Auto-matique des Sources du Bas Moyen Age has been also devoted to automatic prosopography</title> . <note>In the course of her thesis on the members of the Paris Parliament in the later Middle Ages</note>, <title level="a">Fran-Goise Autrand has reconstructed the biographies of 676 indivi-duals( 17 ) ; and 1 am working myself an a set of 750 english historians who lived between 1300 and 1600 : there is a lot of classifying, cross-tabulation and indexation to be done on such collections, but factorial analysis will also be used (18) since it has produced very interesting results in the study of the (19) biographies of the canons of Laon made by Mrs . Helene Millet The Same course will be followed for the collections of bio-graphies which are being prepared by Alain Demurger (the baillis of the King of France in the fifteenth century) and by Mrs. Elisabeth Mornet (Danish clerics with a university education). Factorial analysis seems to be a very convenient technique (20) for the historian, for it enables him to depict and to summarize his documentation, as well as it provides him with a secure guidance for interpretation : another successful application of factorial analysis to historical data which deserves notice is Mrs</title> . <note>Fran9oise Micheau&apos;s thesis on translations from the arabic (21 -7 Surprisingly enough, fiscal history does not seem to have bene -fited from the computer potentialities as much as other sectors. Nevertheless, a remarkable success has been achieved by Jacques Lefort who has been able to discover the rate of taxation em-ployed in the Byzantine Empire during the fourteenth century by comparing several rolls of imposition (praktika) : this is a good example of how the computer may,help the historian in bringing . to light a part of reality which the traditional historian would have thought lost for ever</note> (<biblScope unit="issue">22</biblScope>) .</bibl>
	<bibl><title level="m">This survey is far from complete</title> (<biblScope unit="issue">23</biblScope>) . <title level="a">A better idea of what is going on among French medievalists interested by quantification and computerization will be obtained when the results of the inquiry supervised by Lucie Fossier with the help of Christiane Klapisch, Jacques Lefort and myself will have found their way to the column of Computer and Medieval Data Progressing . The publi-cation of the reports read at the Rome colloquium in 1975 will also provide many new informations on the researches of</title> <author>F .Autrand, L. Fossier, Ch . Klapisch, J . Lefort, M . Parisse, J . Verger, M.</author> <title level="a">Zerner and many others</title> . <title level="a">But much is still to be done : access to machines with good performing capacities remains sometimes difficult, especially in provincial universities, and financial support is largely inadequate : this is partly due to the fact that accounting systems in computing centres have been devised to meet the mathematician&apos;s or physicist&apos;s needs, and are very unfavourable to historians who are great consumers of reading and printing time, and comparatively small consumers of calculus time . But the most important drawback is still the lack of infor-mation</title>, <note>and even more seriously, the lack of formation of most historians : in that respect, if medievalists are not worse than their colleagues working on other periods, they are not better . .</note>.</bibl>

Manfred Küchler presented a &apos;paper de-scribing his DIEC-model for analyzing nominal scaled data . This approach combines the Goodman and Harder models and makes it possible to explain variances in a dependent dichotomous variable by the combined effects of more than one dichotomous independent variables . In the discussion it was stressed that especially historical data are often available only as categorical data and that therefore models based on low levels of measurement would be very appropriate for historical research</title> . <note>Examples from historical research mentioned by the audience made apparent the potentials of this kind of data analysis techniques</note> .</bibl>

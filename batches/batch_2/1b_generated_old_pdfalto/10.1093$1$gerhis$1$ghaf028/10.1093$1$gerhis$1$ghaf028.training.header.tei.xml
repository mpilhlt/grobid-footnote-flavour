	Introduction<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In 1912, looking back on the Agadir crisis, the American naval officer and noted his-<lb/>torian French Ensor Chadwick summarized the contemporary situation in Europe:<lb/> We see the two foremost nations of Europe, the two most highly civilised nations of the world, spending<lb/> vast sums; the one striving to overtake, the other striving to preserve, supremacy in maritime power. Can<lb/> anyone say that the game of Morocco was worth the candle? […] Is England to be destroyed by Germany,<lb/> or Germany to be destroyed by England, or France to disappear as France because the special trader wants<lb/> an extension of his field? […] It would seem that the words Delenda est Cartago [sic] must be in the hearts of<lb/> many, both German and English. But why this feeling? The Englishman cannot hate the German per se,<lb/> nor the German the Englishman to the extent of desiring one to annihilate the other. There must be some<lb/> deep and powerful reason which does not appear upon the surface […] This reason is in that ever most<lb/> potent cause of international dissension-trade jealousy. 1<lb/> Chadwick&apos;s assertion-that global trade and the zero-sum competitive nature of pre-<lb/>1914 imperial globalization had led to a poisoning of Anglo-German relations-has<lb/> loomed large in historiography ever since the First World War. Echoing sentiments<lb/> perhaps most famously outlined in the British Foreign Office memorandum penned by<lb/> Eyre Crowe in 1907, some historians have argued that the conduct of the two powers<lb/> during several international crises supports this antagonism paradigm. 2 Whether re-<lb/>counting the two Moroccan crises, the scramble for Africa, the Samoan tangle, differ-<lb/>ences over the Boer War, competition in East Asia or naval rivalry in the North Sea,<lb/> the story is ostensibly always the same: a threatening Germany forcing concession after<lb/> concession from a reluctant Britain.<lb/></div>

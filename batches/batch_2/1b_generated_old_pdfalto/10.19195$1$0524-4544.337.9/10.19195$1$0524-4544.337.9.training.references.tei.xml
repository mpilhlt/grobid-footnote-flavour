(b) ensure security of energy supply in the Union; (c) promote energy efficiency and energy saving and the development of new and renewable forms of energy; and (d) promote the interconnection of energy networks. importantly, the assurance of the functioning of the energy market was stated in first place, which was fully reflected in the legislation at that time targeted at further opening up the energy market (the so-called third Package), especially the development of competition, implemented, among other things, through the prin-ciple of the free choice of energy and gas supplier and the protection of consumers, especially the so-called &quot;most vulnerable customers</title>&quot;. <title level="a">18 and although experts claim the process of forming the internal energy market has ended, it should be stated that a competitive energy market is a necessary prerequisite for the transformation of the monopolized energy market into a distributed and prosumer system. 19 an important reinforcement of the eU&apos;s competence in energy was the intro-duction of certain areas of energy policy into the scope of shared competence in article 194 tFeU, which, in turn, opened the path for the creation of a common energy policy. even so, each Member state retained the right &quot;to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply&quot; (article 194(2)). simultaneously, taking into account the systemic interpretation of the treaty, it should be pointed out that article 194 tFeU is immediately preceded by the title Environment (articles 191-193 tFeU), which suggests that there is a need to con-nect these two issues. this is also confirmed by the wording of article 11 tFeU, 16 see the treaty amending the treaty on european Union and the treaty establishing the european community, signed at Lisbon on 13 december</title> <date>2007</date> (oJ eU c no. <biblScope unit="issue">306</biblScope>, p. <biblScope unit="page">1</biblScope>). <title level="a">17 it should be pointed out that, in terms of energy policy, primary law contains a number of other specific provisions, which primarily include article 122 tFeU (security of supply), arti-cles 170-172 tFeU (energy networks), article 114 tFeU (internal electricity market) and articles 216-218 tFeU (external energy policy). 18 the third package was targeted at the further integration of the national energy systems and the development of competition</title>. in particular, directive <date>2009</date>/<title level="a">72/ec introduced the principle of ownership unbundling, namely the unbundling of ownership of energy and natural gas transmission activities from other energy activities</title>, <note>as well as the establishment of the acer agency, namely the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators, under regulation 713/2009 for coordinating regulatory activities in the Member states. see directive 2009/72/ec of the european Parliament and of the council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing directive 2003/54/ec;

For the purposes of these consider-ations, it should be stated that the last element of this legislative package, namely regulation 2018/1999 on the governance of the energy Union 33 that constituted the five dimensions of the energy union, which are closely interlinked and mutu-ally reinforcing, has created the greatest impact on the shape of energy policy. ac-cording to article 1(2), these include energy security, the internal energy market, energy efficiency, decarbonization and research, innovation and competitiveness. it should be pointed out that these dimensions coincide with the treaty&apos;s energy policy objectives, as formulated in article 194(1) tFeU, but there is a change of emphasis in this case, as energy security is positioned in first place. this regula-tion refers to the Member states and the european Union preparing long-term strategies as a &quot;governance mechanism&quot;, including integrated national energy and climate plans every ten years, starting from the period 2021-2030 (article 3). simultaneously, the obligation to present a progress report every two years and to prepare coherent long-term national strategies to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement was laid down. it is worth noting that article 11 of the regula-tion provides for the need to organize a multilevel climate and energy dialogue, in which local authorities are able to actively engage, alongside civil society or-ganizations, businesses, investors and other stakeholders. it should therefore be stated that local and regional authorities must necessarily actively participate in the process of shaping individual energy and climate policy scenarios</title>, <note>as well as integrated national energy and climate plans in the specific area. 33 regulation (eU) 2018/1999 of the european Parliament and of the council of 11 decem-ber 2018 on the governance of the energy Union and climate action, amending certain regulations and directives. the evolution of the european Union&apos;s energy policy</note> <biblScope unit="volume">113</biblScope></bibl>
	<bibl>, <note>such as agriculture, transport and construction. the holistic approach appears in the nature of the commission&apos;s communication, because the european green deal is a holistic eU development strategy (a so-called cross-sectoral strategy</note>), <title level="a">setting long-term goals in a number of interrelated areas. as the european green deal communication is not legally binding, the need arose to legally sanction the goal of climate neutrality. a regulation named the eu-ropean climate Law was adopted in 2021. 34 this is a key element and the starting point for future eU legislation and law-making for pursuing all the assumptions of the european green deal. the formulation of this act refers to a number of eU regulations and policies and is not limited exclusively to energy matters. it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;climate treaty&quot; because, although it was issued in the form of a regulation, it is a secondary regulation and has an unprecedented sig-nificance and scope. in a nutshell, the climate Law is a comprehensive legal tool for economically transforming the eU to bring about a zero-carbon economy. 35 the adoption of the european climate Law constitutes the normative sanc-tioning of the goal of climate neutrality, however, a subsequent need arose to redefine the eU&apos;s energy policy to date by reviewing all existing legislation. con-sequently, another, fifth legislative package named &quot;Fit for 55&quot; was developed, which was promulgated in the commission communication of 2021 36 and ad-opted by the council on 25 april 2023 as the final stage of the legislative proce-dure. it was adopted in the light of fierce opposition from Poland, although this opposition was not taken into account because of the applicability of the ordinary legislative procedure for shared competences, to which the matter regulated by the package belongs (see: article 194 tFeU, as already discussed). in general terms, the legislation contained in &quot;Fit for 55&quot; is targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the main sectors of the economy and supporting citizens and micro-enterprises</title>, <note>as well as sectors at risk of carbon leakage. the core objective 34 regulation (eU) 2021/1119 of the european Parliament and of the council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending regulations (ec) no. 401/2009 and (eU) 2018/1999 (european climate Law) (oJ.L 243/1 of 2021</note>).</bibl>

Furthermore, it should be stated in conclusion that tracking the evolution of eU energy policy reveals the ambivalent nature of the energy sector. in traditional terms, the energy sector is viewed as an engine for the economic development of countries, which was most fully reflected in the reasons for establishing the euro-pean coal and steel community in 1952 as a community of economic interests to secure access to strategic energy sources, namely coal and nuclear fuel. However, today, energy based on high-carbon sources is a factor which hinders the socio-economic development of a country, which can be fully applied to the current situation in Poland. therefore, this is not so much an evolution in the perception of the significance of the energy sector, as it is still key to modern economies, but the setting of the climate neutrality objective has caused a systemic change in the valuation of energy sources according to the criterion of emissivity, and it is precisely an energy mix based on low-carbon sources that constitutes the basis of competitive advantage. Meanwhile, the evolution of the energy policy primarily presents an incred-ible increase in the visibility of the timeless values on which the european Union is based. While the reforms of the first three liberalization packages targeted at creat-ing, administering and modernizing the single market prioritize economic values, the adoption of the treaty of Lisbon in 2007 and the ratification of the respective Un conventions and agreements has seen an exponential increase in the significance of climate protection and</title>, <note>with it</note>, <note>such fundamental values as the common good, health and human life, freedom, justice and intergenerational solidarity</note>. <note>Translated by Roman Wojtasz references adamczewska n., zajączkowska M., &quot;realizacja zrównoważonej polityki energetycznej Unii eu-ropejskiej w kontekście celów zrównoważonego rozwoju (sdg) -wybrane aspekty</note>,&quot; <title level="j">Folia Iuridica Universitatis Wratislaviensis</title> <biblScope unit="volume">11</biblScope>, <date>2002</date>, no. <biblScope unit="issue">2</biblScope>, pp. <biblScope unit="page">9-25</biblScope>.</bibl>

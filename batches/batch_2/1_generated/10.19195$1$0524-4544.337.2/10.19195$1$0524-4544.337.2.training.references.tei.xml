Later in the article -in accordance with its subject matter -the attention will be focused on the legal and organizational drivers determining the quality of changes in the area of energy transition, or rather, on a specific aspect of these two categories of driv-ers, namely networking. the objective of the paper is to present the two funda-mental networking mechanisms of energy transition, which, in the Polish legal order, are energy clusters and energy cooperatives, and to compare the two mech-anisms with each other. the paper uses the method of content analysis of legal regulations (eU and national) and specialised literature on the subject. the article is interdisciplinary in nature, not limiting itself to an analysis of legal regulations but referring to findings from other scientific disciplines. since energy clusters and energy cooperatives represent a business model for local energy generation and balancing, it is reasonable to refer to the literature on the subject especially in the area of management science, sociology. restricting oneself to an analysis of legal regulations makes it impossible to explain the mechanism of operation of these two mechanisms of local energy production from res</title>. pp. <biblScope unit="page">283-301</biblScope>; <note>t. ylä-anttila</note> (<author>et al.</author>), &quot;<title level="a">climate change policy networks: Why and how to compare them across countries</title>,&quot; <title level="j">Energy Research &amp; Social Science</title> <biblScope unit="volume">45</biblScope>, <date>2018</date>, pp. <biblScope unit="page">258-265</biblScope>; <note>d.J. gordon, &quot;the orchestration of global urban climate governance: conducting power in the post-Paris climate regime</note>,&quot; <title level="j">Environmental Politics</title> <biblScope unit="volume">26</biblScope>, <date>2017</date>, no. <biblScope unit="issue">4</biblScope>, pp. <biblScope unit="page">694-714</biblScope>;</bibl>

By taking into account the dual nature of the activity of energy collectives, each of them can be seen to be of a unique nature and creates a unique ecosystem which is appropriate to itself. simultaneously, within the framework of this activity, the red ii directive requires Member states to provide energy communities with the right to: (1) generate, (2) consume, (3) store and (4) sell renewable energy. Furthermore, the provisions of the directive require Member states to provide tools to energy collectives or entities that would like to start to collaborate within such organizational solutions</title>, <note>which help them gain access to information and financing, as well as to establish mechanisms at the</note> <title level="a">level of the Member states for promoting and developing them. therefore, the Member states have the role of creating an institutional (regulatory) environment for the effective functioning of energy communities within their areas. and committees in a norwegian island parish</title>,&quot; <title level="j">Human Relations</title> <biblScope unit="volume">7</biblScope>, <date>1954</date>, no. <biblScope unit="issue">1</biblScope>, pp. <biblScope unit="page">39-58</biblScope>. , <title level="a">enterprises with systems used for generating renewable energy.

Positive interdependence is a state in which, when interpreting specific economic, technological, legal, social, etc. conditions, a particular entity concludes that it can achieve its individual objectives if and only if another entity operating</title> <note>in the same conditions is able to achieve its individual objectives. the existence of a group of entities pursuing objectives that are not in conflict with each other and which share the same system of values, convictions and expectations can constitute the impetus for seeking structural methods of consolidating their compatible aims, activities and interests. network organizations are among these structural methods of consolidating compatible interests</note>, <note>which are always dependent on the specific socio-economic</note></bibl>
	<bibl>nucleus. &quot;<note>soft&quot; infrastructure -research facilities, local government institutions, busi-ness development agencies and stakeholders. the logic of creating energy network collectives encompasses the activation of local communities in terms of cooperation and the generation of energy from renewable sources. the energy cluster, as a network organization, is intended to enable energy self-sufficiency to be achieved in the municipality and to bring about an increase in the level of energy security. the</note> <title level="a">pursuit of an objective pre-sented in this way requires a high level of investment in technical, generation and metering infrastructure and therefore the commitment of private capital, know-ledge and activity. energy clusters are therefore a networking formula for achiev-ing the planned objective, which is achievable through cooperation with the involvement of external capital. the essence of a network organization is to achieve the effect of synergy through the cooperation of its participants. therefore, the coordination mech-anisms that are typical of an energy cluster, which have a subjective and an objective dimension, play an important role within the energy cluster. the so-called coordinator of the network organization is responsible for the efficiency of coordination in the subject dimension. 12 the legislator emphasizes the role of the coordinator as a link that represents the cluster&apos;s interests externally, 13 while the logic of operation forces the coordinator (the network creator, broker, network centre) to simultaneously play an important role directed towards the inside of the cluster -to secure the ability to pursue the individual interests of the members of the cluster and reconcile the often conflicting and particular interests of its members. the need for the coordinator&apos;s inward-looking activity arises from the 12 the act on res (article 2[15a]) stipulates that the coordinator representing the cluster&apos;s interests externally is a cooperative, association, foundation, or any member of the energy cluster spe-cified in the civil law agreement, who is appointed to represent the cluster (it can also be an entity established for this purpose</title>, e.g. a partnership or a company). <title level="a">the coordinator&apos;s functions laid down by the legislator are to manage and represent the energy cluster in business dealings, regarding the projects that are being implemented. the coordinator may be and, in practice, often is the initiator and founder of the cluster, or a new entity specified by the participants in the cluster contract. the act does not specify the scope and principles of representation by the coordinator in the cluster; it leaves the freedom to make this decision to the members of the cluster. 13 the statutory emphasis of the activities of the cluster&apos;s coordinator, which are externally oriented, arises from the lack of personality and legal capacity of this network form of cooperation. networking of legal and organizational solutions in energy transition 17 duality of relations that are typical of an energy cluster, i.e. the simultaneous pres-ence of competition and cooperation. 14 the phenomenon of simultaneous compe-tition and cooperation that exists in clusters is referred to as coopetition (from the combination of the words cooperation and competition). 15 the cluster coordinator is responsible for preparing the rules and harmonizing cooperation between the network participants and the stakeholders. the ability to cooperate despite the existence of frequent individual competing objectives in economic, technical and organizational terms is important, namely those of electricity consumers, lo-cal government, which is responsible, among other things, for preparing energy supply plans, as well as generators and distributors. coordination in the objective dimension in energy clusters is created by two mechanisms: contractual and rela-tional. the source of the identification of these two coordination mechanisms lies in the division of organizations into formal and informal ones. the criteria for the typology of network organizations are sought in various areas which cannot be discussed exhaustively because of the restrictions on this article. the determinants of the delimitation of organizational networks</title>, <note>which are of significance in the context of the analysis of the logic of the operation of energy clusters, include the criterion from the praxeological theory of organization of the</note> <title level="a">division of organi-zational relations into formal and informal relations, 16 which simultaneously enables a distinction to be made between formal and informal network organizations. Formal network organizations are established via a contract as the legal basis for the establishment of the cooperation. the contract should provide a general legal framework, which is optimal for cooperation and trade taking place within the network organization, as well as between the organizational network and the consumers. in the english language literature, the operation of formal network or-ganizations is identified with the presence of so-called mechanisms of contractual coordination, of which open, formalized and written contracts are an attribute. 17 , also emphasizes this duality, defining a cluster as &quot;a spatial and sectoral concentration of at least 10 entities working for economic development or innovation. When performing their activities within one or several neighbouring voivodships, they compete and cooperate with each other in the same or related sectors and are connected by an extensive network of relations of a formal and informal nature</title>&quot; (<note>Journal of Laws of</note> <date>2006</date>, no. <biblScope unit="issue">226</biblScope>, item <date>1651</date>). <note>15 see: k.

Positive externalities arise when horizontally-connected organizations pro-vide benefits from their operations to other entities without directly receiving compensation for this. examples of positive externalities are the processes of cre-ating energy clusters, which, while starting up network rent directly for its par-ticipants, simultaneously transfer the effects of their existence to other entities in the form of benefits identified at local and/or regional level, which include an increase in energy security, a reduction in the economy&apos;s energy consumption, the creation of new jobs, an increase in the attractiveness of investment land by reducing the costs of energy supply, the stimulation of economic development, the availability and development of low-carbon public transport and the reduction of harmful gas emissions. the third function of the law -optimization -involves the creation of a legal basis for the conclusion of a contract and the execution of its provisions, enabling the participants of the cluster to reduce transaction costs. 24 the concluded contract creating the energy cluster is a result of the clash of inter-ests of the parties to the contract</title>, <note>who, due to their awareness of the existence of 21 see: a.

Both models -energy clusters and energy cooperatives -have their advantages in terms of energy production and distribution. Ultimately, which model is more beneficial for a region depends on the individual needs and condi-tions of the local community. energy clusters occur as groups of organisations and companies pooling their resources to produce and distribute energy on a larger scale. the cluster initiative is often based on innovative technological solutions, resulting in more efficient use of energy sources and increased production effi-ciency. energy cooperatives, on the other hand, are organisations owned by mem-bers of the local community who jointly manage the production and distribution of energy. arises from the presence of the determinants of the energy transition and their impact on its effectiveness. 37 the interaction between legal and social conditions and the barriers to change that exist within them is significant. the legal regulations, as well as the attitudes, convictions and awareness of members of a given community, determine whether it is possible to make any changes, as well as the quality of these changes. the per-ceived lack of activity in establishing energy cooperatives arises precisely from the social conditions, namely barriers in the form of their negative perception in Poland, which are perceived as a relic from the times of the People&apos;s republic of Poland. the legal and social conditions can be positioned on matrix of changes in the area of energy transformation (Figure 2). 37 the article has addressed the existence of conditions (legal, organizational, social, technological and commercial) which are interrelated and therefore exert an influence on the effectiveness of the transformation. networking of legal and organizational solutions in energy transition 27 the design of the matrix is based on axes scaled from 1 to 9</title>, on <note>which two orientations in the introduction of changes are presented: the orientation to con-duct transformations on the basis of legal regulations (so-called hard levers) and the orientation to conduct transformations on the basis of changes in the ways of thinking, the perception of the environment, attitudes and habits (soft levers</note>). <note>it becomes possible to distinguish five ways of bringing about change on this basis: 1.

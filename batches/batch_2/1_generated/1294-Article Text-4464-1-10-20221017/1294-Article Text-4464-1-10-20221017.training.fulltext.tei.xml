			<figure type="table">The Journey To Legal Capability: Challenges for Public Law from Public Legal<lb/> Education<lb/> Abiodun Michael Olatokun 1<lb/></figure>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Citizens whose rights are infringed by a public authority are often unable to attain a court<lb/> judgment to challenge those adverse decisions. The trite explanation is the most<lb/> compelling; judicial review is a prohibitively expensive process. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> This high cost of<lb/> litigation combined with the fees charged by public lawyers can make fighting for one&apos;s<lb/> legal rights inaccessible to those without independent means or publicly funded legal<lb/> representation. There is no question that this is a complete explanation for many instances<lb/> of unmet legal need, but this paper seeks to raise another important barrier to access to<lb/> justice that is seldom discussed in the recent literature.<lb/></p>

			<p>Legal capability is defined as the knowledge, skills and confidence required to participate<lb/> in legal systems and to deal with one&apos;s legal issues. It is thought to be improved through<lb/> 1 Barrister (Lincoln&apos;s Inn), Lecturer in Law (London South Bank University) and Inaugural Member<lb/> (Solicitor General&apos;s Public Legal Education Committee). Former Research Leader in Citizenship and the<lb/> Rule of Law (Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law)<lb/> programmes of Public Legal Education (PLE). <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Whilst the author reiterates that legal<lb/> education is no replacement for state-funded legal advice for the poor, PLE is a crucial<lb/> tool in helping people to challenge public decision making.<lb/></p>

			<p>The UN, amongst others, has suggested that governments can prevent civil legal<lb/> problems from spiralling out of control by giving those affected the tools to self-diagnose<lb/> and, where appropriate, act with support to enable them to intervene. <ref type="biblio">4<lb/></ref> The author is both an academic representing pedagogical ideas to the government and a<lb/> civil society activist working to implement programmes of PLE in varied settings. These<lb/> experiences will be used to examine the (minimal) effectiveness of initiatives such as the<lb/> placement of human rights into the National Curriculum for Citizenship Education in<lb/> 2013 and the requirement that all English schools promote the &apos;fundamental British value&apos;<lb/> of the Rule of Law.<lb/></p>

			<p>This article further argues that the state can provide meaningful information about public<lb/> authorities&apos; duties and citizens&apos; entitlements through public legal information, and that<lb/> there is a moral impetus for it to do so. A concrete plan for doing so would work to ensure<lb/> that those subject to unlawful administrative decision making have the legal capability<lb/> to mitigate further damage to their interests and pursue the correct decision.<lb/></p>

			<head>Access to justice and the rule of law are broader than legal aid<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to justice has underpinned English notions of fairness in the legal system since<lb/> Magna Carta stated that &quot;to no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.&quot; <ref type="biblio">5<lb/></ref> This was echoed some 800 years later by British judge Lord Bingham of Cornhill, who<lb/> laid out a definition of the rule of law that is striking in its clarity. He described two<lb/> hallmarks of the rule of law which are of major relevance to this paper; the first that &quot;the<lb/> law must be accessible and so far as possible, intelligible, clear and practicable.&quot; <ref type="biblio">6</ref> The<lb/> second principle is that &quot;means must be provided for resolving, without prohibitive cost<lb/> or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties are themselves unable to<lb/> resolve.&quot; <ref type="biblio">7<lb/></ref> The practical significance of these principles is that the law should be comprehensible in<lb/> order to justify its binding role on the actions of citizens, and that the state should provide<lb/> opportunities to resolve incorrect decisions made about those citizens; there should be<lb/> access to justice. This line of thinking was key to the reasoning of the Supreme Court in<lb/> Unison where Lord Reed goes so far as to say that access to the courts is &quot;inherent in the<lb/> rule of law. <ref type="biblio">8</ref></p>

 &quot;<lb/></head>

			<p>The idea that the government has a necessary role to play in ensuring access to justice is<lb/> baked into the psyche of the British state. How did it come to be so pivotal? As a welfarist<lb/> political consensus emerged after the Second World War, the Atlee government enacted<lb/> the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949. This Act created the Legal Aid Board which would<lb/> provide those of &quot;small or moderate means&quot; with the necessary funding to secure legal<lb/> representation for their civil legal problems. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> Legal aid has been largely viewed as a welcome achievement, but its operation has not<lb/> been without criticism. Eligibility for legal aid has always been targeted at the most hard-<lb/>pressed, and as such decisions to grant funding are subject to a means test. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> This means<lb/> test has the potential to leave lower-middle class individuals subject to a legal problem<lb/> undercompensated if they take a party to court, as they are unlikely to recover all of the<lb/> costs of representation even if successful. <ref type="biblio">11<lb/></ref> This was exacerbated by a change of policy by the UK government as the country entered<lb/> the second decade of the 21st century. Conservative Party Chancellor of the Exchequer<lb/> reduced the Ministry of Justice budget. This was wrought by the Legal Aid, Sentencing<lb/> and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) which paved the way for the legal aid<lb/> budget to be cut by over 1billion over the next ten years, <ref type="biblio">12</ref> creating a situation described<lb/> by the Law Society as &apos;a wide[r] and detrimental effect on society&apos;&apos;. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> Drilling down to the regional level, there are whole areas of the United Kingdom in which<lb/> there are no qualified legal aid solicitors specialising in given areas of law. This problem<lb/> has become so pronounced that industry estimates suggest that in 2021, 40% of the<lb/> population of England &amp; Wales did not have a local legal aid provider working in the<lb/> area of housing law. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> More worryingly for present purposes, these &apos;advice deserts&apos; are<lb/> most stark in the public law jurisdiction, where approximately 80% of judicial reviews<lb/> between 2018-2020 were heard in London, despite the region containing approximately<lb/> 7% of the UK population. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Thomas argues that this &quot;large but largely hidden and ignored<lb/> landscape&quot; operates &quot;outside the main political agenda&quot; and is thus not a prominent or<lb/> oft-discussed public policy issue. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> It is clear that there is unmet legal need for judicial<lb/> review in most parts of the country; if you live outside the capital, your ability to<lb/> challenge public decision making is severely limited.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is worth reminding ourselves of the importance of legally aided litigation. Cases of<lb/> central importance to our democracy have arisen from legally aided claimants who<lb/> would otherwise have been unable to bring these cases, of which Donoghue v Stephenson<lb/> is the most infamous. Had Ms Donoghue not been able to bring her case, she would not<lb/> have been compensated for the harm that she suffered, but more crucially the principle<lb/> that we owe each other a duty of care to prevent reasonably foreseeable harms would not<lb/> have resulted. It is uncontroversial to say that legal aid, and the legal assistance that it<lb/> facilitates, is much needed in realising rights.<lb/></p>

			<p>Legal aid is irreplaceable and serves an important role, but its apotheosis as the main<lb/> element of the post-Atlee welfare state is highly problematic. As the replacement of the<lb/> Legal Aid Board with the Legal Services Commission and later the Legal Aid Agency<lb/> would show, the body was prone to severe disruption by changing political priorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Legal aid was born in an era of post-war political consensus in which Conservative<lb/> politicians were more comfortable with supporting social welfare programmes. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> This<lb/> would not last into the Thatcher administration. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> By contrast the rather tentative<lb/> establishment of PLE has been a more politically palatable concept accepted by both<lb/> Labour and Conservative MPs. <ref type="biblio">19<lb/></ref> The practical significance of this point is that in a situation where the justice sector is at<lb/> loggerheads with the government over the funding of legal representation, PLE may be<lb/> an easier tactical target for public interest campaigns than legal aid.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond this further support for PLE is a sustainable investment for creating active,<lb/> knowledgeable citizens. Some of the greatest gains in legal rights are achieved by using<lb/> the law outside of the courtroom. Civic participation in Scotland, the so-called &apos;Snowdrop<lb/> campaign&apos; saw the UK Government pass the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 to prohibit<lb/> the possession of small firearms. The National Farmers&apos; Union organised blockades in<lb/> order to argue for a reduction in fuel tax. Though unsuccessful in this aim, they succeeded<lb/> in securing a freeze of fuel prices. 20 These were sophisticated operations in which<lb/> professional activists used their knowledge of the different &apos;levers&apos; that could be pulled<lb/> in order to achieve societal change. Such an assessment requires the knowledge, skills<lb/> and confidence to deal with law related issues in one&apos;s life; in other words, &apos;legal<lb/> capability&apos;. <ref type="biblio">21<lb/></ref> We don&apos;t currently have a legal obligation to teach about the law<lb/> It has been established above that widespread legal capability is crucial to the<lb/> achievement of access to justice through the rule of law. As the Public Legal Education<lb/> and Advice Service task force stated, PLE is the tool needed to achieve legal capability. <ref type="biblio">22<lb/></ref> One might then ask the question, what levers does the UK government pull in order to<lb/> ensure provision of PLE?<lb/></p>

			<p>The political geography of the UK makes this question more complex. Education is a<lb/> devolved competence in the UK, meaning that the devolved administrations of Northern<lb/> Ireland, Scotland and Wales maintain their own national approaches. There is an<lb/> awkwardness in the fact that we wish to teach students about the English and Welsh legal<lb/> system, yet England and Wales pursue different approaches to education. The author is<lb/> a product of the English education system and this chapter focuses explicitly on the<lb/> English context.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is currently no effective legal obligation requiring the UK government to ensure<lb/> that every English citizen has legal capability; nor is there an obligation to implement<lb/> PLE across England. PLE has not been the subject of litigation in the United Kingdom,<lb/> and so the common law does not provide any assistance in this area. Similarly, there are<lb/> several international treaties that reference PLE&apos;s cognate concepts (especially citizenship<lb/> education) but these are not directly effective in the UK; the UK is a &apos;dualist&apos; system in<lb/> which international law and treaties need further national legislation in order to confer<lb/> real rights.<lb/></p>

			<p>The major treaties calling on the UK government to implement aspects of PLE are:<lb/></p>

			<p>• UN Declaration Human Rights Education and Training (&apos;UDHRET&apos;) <ref type="biblio">23<lb/></ref> • UN Convention on the Rights of the Child<lb/></p>

			<head>• Council of Europe Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human<lb/></head>

			<p>Rights Education (&apos;the Charter&apos;) <ref type="biblio">24<lb/></ref> Despite a clear thread throughout these instruments that young people should be taught<lb/> about their rights, these treaties are seldom referred to in the work of Parliament. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The<lb/> inability of these instruments to encourage action from politicians was illustrated in an<lb/></p>

			<figure>almost two-hour-long Westminster Hall Debate in which members failed to reference any<lb/> of these obligations. 26<lb/> Domestic legislation involving PLE has also been threadbare. The most compelling<lb/> provision is s1(g) of the Legal Services Act 2007 (LSA 2007) which imposes an obligation<lb/> upon the Legal Services Board (LSB) to &quot;increasing public understanding of the citizen&apos;s<lb/> legal rights and duties.&quot;<lb/> Though the placement of this obligation in statute is novel, and of relevance to the current<lb/> discussion it is deficient in several respects. Put simply, imposing the obligation on the<lb/> LSB doesn&apos;t guarantee any PLE activity. Legal professionals are not best placed to<lb/> provide such an onerous duty alongside their core role, representing clients. The LSB<lb/> itself is not a &apos;front-line regulator&apos; but instead a &apos;regulator of regulators&apos; in essence acting<lb/> through regulators such as the Bar Standards Board and Solicitors Regulatory Authority<lb/> to influence lawyers. This means that the LSB has made a modest number of PLE<lb/> interventions (such as running the collaborative &apos;Justice Week&apos; campaign) and the impact<lb/> of the LSA 2007 has been limited in respect of legal capability.<lb/> 26 HC Deb 15 May 2018, vol 641 col 80WH<lb/> 38<lb/> LSB Justice Week Events<lb/> The most authoritative and influential obligation to deliver PLE is the framework<lb/> surrounding the Education Act 2002. S78 of the Act states that maintained schools should<lb/> provide a &apos;balanced and broadly based curriculum&apos; which &apos;promotes the spiritual, moral,<lb/> cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society&apos;. This<lb/> obligation would go on to be known as &apos;SMSC&apos; by the teaching profession. The<lb/> Department for Education modified this requirement in September 2014 to require SMSC<lb/> to include promotion of the &apos;Fundamental British Values&apos;. These &apos;FBVs&apos; comprise:<lb/> 1. democracy,<lb/> 2. the rule of law,<lb/> 3. individual liberty and<lb/> 4. mutual respect and tolerance for those of different and no faiths.<lb/></figure>

			<p>This new requirement was complemented by the Department for Education guidance,<lb/> &apos;Promoting fundamental British values through SMSC&apos;. This document sets out a highly<lb/> 39<lb/> rigid and conformist notion of law with the rather regrettable expression that &quot;The<lb/> school&apos;s ethos and teaching, which schools should make parents aware of, should<lb/> support the rule of English civil and criminal law and schools should not teach anything<lb/> that undermines it.&quot; <ref type="biblio">27<lb/></ref> These highly individualised forms of legal education focus specifically around the<lb/> individual&apos;s responsibility to shape their family life and home affairs in such a way as to<lb/> avoid criminal liability. This is important, but incomplete; these incentives do not<lb/> encourage students to consider how they might campaign collectively to achieve societal<lb/> justice or how they might pursue law reform or how they might act with others to create<lb/> political change. They encourage the idea that the status quo is optimal without<lb/> consideration of alternatives. <ref type="biblio">28<lb/></ref> The Attorney General&apos;s Office would make another significant intervention in this area<lb/> in 2017 in the formation of the Solicitor General&apos;s &apos;PLE Panel&apos;, <ref type="biblio">29</ref> which would later be<lb/> renamed the &apos;Solicitor General&apos;s PLE Committee&apos;. This group comprised a group of<lb/> experts who would work with the minister to produce a PLE action plan over the next 18<lb/> months. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> The author worked with then-Solicitor General Robert Buckland QC MP to<lb/> launch a government vision statement at a combined meeting of the All-Party<lb/> Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Rule of Law and the APPG on PLE and Pro Bono. <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref> The action plan 32 stated that seven goals should be pursued in order to correct deficiencies<lb/> in the delivery of PLE:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. PLE will be supported by a robust evidence base, showing what the need is and<lb/> what works best,<lb/> 2. PLE will be of high quality, maintained to ensure that it remains accurate and<lb/> accessible and useful for the people who need it,<lb/> 3. PLE will be universal and reach across all demographics, prioritising children,<lb/> young adults and vulnerable groups,<lb/> 4. PLE will be scaled up through delivery by the legal community,<lb/> 5. PLE will harness technology and be delivered through innovative methods, both<lb/> on and offline,<lb/> 6. PLE will be embedded into public services and government departments<lb/> 7. PLE will be understood as beneficial and utilised by other sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although this launch was enthusiastically attended by the justice sector, and overtures<lb/> were made to PLE in the Attorney General&apos;s Business Plan for 2020-2021, the action plan<lb/> has so far resulted in minimal activity at the time of writing this piece some three years<lb/> later. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> This could be in part due to the de facto role the Solicitor General has assumed in<lb/> representing PLE within government. The Solicitor General post suffered from the<lb/> politically unstable zeitgeist as six appointments were made to the role between July 2019<lb/> and September 2022. This period also saw the longest-running minister in this period,<lb/> Michael Ellis QC MP, given additional responsibility for the government&apos;s response to<lb/> the COVID-19 pandemic.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a leading member of the group it is my view that the Solicitor General&apos;s PLE<lb/> Committee has not been able to achieve the radical promise set out in its vision.<lb/></p>

			<head>The curriculum operationalised PLE through citizenship education<lb/></head>

			<p>Another major attempt to place PLE at the heart of the English learning experience has<lb/> been through the curriculum. The Crick Report in 1999 facilitated the creation of a new<lb/> national curriculum subject, Citizenship Education. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> It set out the following as essential<lb/> concepts: &apos;fairness, justice, the rule of law, rules, law and human rights&apos;. It stated that<lb/> &apos;civility and respect for the rule of law&apos; were essential values and dispositions. Essential<lb/> elements of knowledge and understanding were &apos;legal and moral rights and<lb/> responsibilities of individuals and communities&apos; and also encouraged teaching &apos;Britain&apos;s<lb/> parliamentary political and legal systems at local, national, European, Commonwealth<lb/> and international level, including how they function and change&apos;. All of these areas of<lb/> knowledge were meant to lead to the development of skills and aptitudes that would<lb/> provide the &apos;ability to identify, respond to and influence social, moral and political<lb/> challenges and situations&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is an international consensus that citizenship education should include teaching<lb/> about law and politics, and that it is the appropriate place in the English student&apos;s<lb/> experience during which they should learn about the rule of law. <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Though not all<lb/> schoolteachers include PLE in their citizenship education lesson plans, English/European<lb/> Citizenship Education frameworks have been designed to make law a crucial part. For<lb/> this reason Citizenship Education and PLE will be used interchangeably throughout this<lb/> paper.<lb/></p>

			<p>The placement of this subject as a compulsory element of the curriculum was a welcome<lb/> boost to legal capability. Educational awarding bodies created GCSE (secondary school<lb/> <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Council of Europe, &quot;Knowledge for Critical Understanding, Education for Democratic Citizenship&quot;<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">20A</ref>. Knowledge and critical understanding of politics, law and human rights<lb/> 43<lb/> leaver exams) and A Levels (exams typically taken prior to higher education) based on<lb/> the principles above. University graduates trained specifically to teach citizenship on<lb/> specialist teaching courses. Though we should not think that these years saw perfect<lb/> provision of PLE throughout the country, this was certainly its heyday, because over the<lb/> subsequent twenty five years there would be significant decline in this subject.<lb/></p>

			<p>The early days of the 2010 coalition government saw the Department for Education<lb/> introduce the Academies Act 2010, which facilitated the transformation in legal status of<lb/> schools formerly attached to their local authority that would now become &apos;academies&apos;<lb/> without an obligation to follow the curriculum. It was at this point that teaching<lb/> Citizenship became a voluntary, rather than compulsory subject for many academised<lb/> schools. 36<lb/></p>

			<head>Citizenship allowed to degrade to a parlous state<lb/></head>

			<p>Several members of the House of Lords who had been involved in the creation of<lb/> Citizenship Education were concerned about its lack of universality across England.<lb/></p>

			<p>Reacting to this concern, Lord Blunkett (who had been the Secretary of State for<lb/> Education presiding over its introduction) and others set up an &apos;ad hoc&apos; select committee<lb/> in 2017, an accountability and oversight mechanism designed to enable short-term<lb/> inquiries into specific issues of interest to members of the Lords.<lb/></p>

			<p>Their educational concerns ran in parallel with wider social issues, such as a downward<lb/> trend in election turnout over the post-war period. <ref type="biblio">37</ref> The &apos;Ad hoc select committee on<lb/> Citizenship and Civic Engagement&apos; heard from an extensive network of experts and<lb/> reported its findings in 2018. Its report produced damning findings of the operation of<lb/> Citizenship Education in England and Wales. They concluded that citizenship education<lb/> in England had been allowed &quot;to degrade to a &quot;parlous state&quot; <ref type="biblio">38</ref> where it was essentially<lb/> unclear whether a random young person leaving the compulsory school system had<lb/> experienced high quality citizenship education at all.<lb/></p>

			<p>The government response to this was unsatisfactory and did not engage with the major<lb/> challenges involved. The (then) Department for Housing, Community and Local<lb/> Government wrote a response that reiterated the importance of Citizenship as a subject<lb/> on the curriculum, spoke of the role that FBVs serve(d) in promoting the rule of law and<lb/> stated that the varying coverage of citizenship education was not a problem because it<lb/> represented a parochial kind of autonomy in which individual schools could make<lb/> choices on the basis of what would be most appropriate. <ref type="biblio">39<lb/></ref> The upshot of this is that the government prioritises local selection of curriculum content<lb/> over the imposition of compulsory parameters. Whilst this gives schools additional<lb/> flexibility, it introduces a much lower common denominator in terms of legal capability.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a system where there is no true &apos;national&apos; curriculum requiring Citizenship Education,<lb/> a child can go through the entire system without developing any measure of legal<lb/> capability. The author argues that this contributes at least in part to major challenges for<lb/> access to justice, such as the Legal Services Board suggestion that up to 36% of the British<lb/> public possess low legal confidence, leading 52% of those to worse legal outcomes than<lb/> others with high legal confidence. <ref type="biblio">40<lb/></ref></p>

 Challenges from a parlous state<lb/></head>

			<p>The fragile state of PLE in England was put to the test as the constitution strained under<lb/> the weight of a febrile atmosphere in which national politics became increasingly<lb/> polarised and tribal. Following the UK&apos;s decision to withdraw from the EU (&apos;Brexit&apos;), the<lb/> UK government entered into extensive negotiations with the EU about the future<lb/> relationship between the nation and the bloc.<lb/></p>

			<p>The EU placed a longstop on those negotiations; existing obligations would expire on 31st<lb/> December 2020 and the UK would &apos;crash out&apos; of the provisional arrangements if no deal<lb/> had been reached by that point. UK Prime Minister Johnson tried unsuccessfully to<lb/> persuade Parliament to pass the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, a legislative instrument<lb/> that would give effect to his negotiated settlement.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a widely criticised move, Johnson sought to end the session of Parliament, reducing<lb/> the number of opportunities MPs would have to scrutinise the legislation. The Supreme<lb/> Court ruled that this was an unlawful act as its effect was to stymie the ability of<lb/> Parliament to hold the executive to account. <ref type="biblio">41 &apos;Miller 2&apos;</ref> suggested that the operation of<lb/> the checks and balances in the UK constitution were operating effectively; the judicial<lb/> branch of government acted effectively to restrain the executive branch from acting<lb/> outside of its powers.<lb/></p>

			<p>But in the words of Ms Miller&apos;s counsel, she is extraordinary; a combative democrat and<lb/> an immensely wealthy woman with high legal and political capability. Where were the<lb/> normal citizens standing up for their rights? <ref type="biblio">42</ref> This raises a question about how PLE can<lb/> contribute to the breadth of engagement in our democracy. Should there have been<lb/> greater social pressure from the public, and a more widespread section of it, upon their<lb/> elected representative to resist this? Must a citizen be well-advised and wealthy to bring<lb/> a major constitutional challenge?<lb/> This point struck most resonantly in the wake of the &apos;Miller 2&apos; case. A YouGov instant<lb/> response poll asked, &quot;the Supreme Court has said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson<lb/> acted unlawfully in proroguing Parliament. Do you agree or disagree with the ruling?&quot; <ref type="biblio">43<lb/></ref> Up to 30 percent of the public disagreed with the court&apos;s orthodox decision, and another<lb/> 21 percent stated that they did not know how they felt. These figures partially illustrate<lb/> the widespread deficiency in legal capability as well as the complex tribalism effected by<lb/> the referendum and the post-2019 Johnson administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Irrespective of the merits of the decision, enforcement of the constitutional order by<lb/> citizens is a contemporary challenge described by the Bingham Centre as an urgent need<lb/> to &apos;democratise&apos; the rule of law. This is an area in which PLE is better placed than judicial<lb/> review representation orders in improving the quality of democratic participation. The<lb/> executive can only be held accountable for breaches of its obligations if individuals are<lb/> able and prepared to challenge public decision making.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">43</ref> YouGov, &quot;By 49% to 30%, Britons agree with the Supreme Court&apos;s ruling that proroguing Parliament<lb/> was unlawful&quot; https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/09/24/49-30-britons-agree-<lb/>supreme-courts-ruling-prorogui accessed 25th July 2022<lb/> 48<lb/></p>

			<head>The UK Government can successfully deliver PLE by reference to similar initiatives<lb/></head>

			<p>There is clear evidence that the UK government can educate and influence the public<lb/> where it desires to do so. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government increased<lb/> its advertising spend on public health messaging by almost 800%. <ref type="biblio">44</ref> Similarly the<lb/> document &apos;Why the Government believes that voting to remain in the European Union<lb/> is the best decision for the UK&apos; (the leaflet) was issued to every household in the UK. <ref type="biblio">45<lb/></ref> This was a requirement of the European Union Referendum Act 2015, and because it was<lb/> placed in legislation this secured sufficient resources for this document.<lb/></p>

			<p>In unpublished research (2016) for the Cabinet Office, I found that the leaflet was an<lb/> effective means of encouraging both private renters and home owners to engage with<lb/> politics, even if the arguments in the leaflet themselves did not ultimately convince them.<lb/> This example has not been followed in a major election or referendum but it provides<lb/> insights that may assist with the current constitutional furore.<lb/></p>

			<p>Amidst the turmoil of Brexit the reigning Conservative Government fought the 2019<lb/> General Election Campaign on a manifesto (the manifesto) that heralded an extensive<lb/> programme of constitutional reform including repeal of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act,<lb/> a review of Parliamentary Constituency boundaries, introducing requirements for<lb/> identification to vote at polling stations and a Constitution, Democracy and Rights<lb/> Commission (CDRC) to &apos;rebalance&apos; the UK constitution. <ref type="biblio">46</ref> This programme of reform was<lb/> described by Unlock Democracy as a &quot;new interventionist role&quot; that &quot;puts our fragile<lb/> rights and liberties in the firing line.&quot; 47 Political theorist Aitchinson has described the<lb/> CRDC as an attempt to &quot;remove the checks and balances of our constitution.&quot; <ref type="biblio">48<lb/></ref> More than two years after the eventual Conservative victory in the 2019 election, the<lb/> CRDC has not resulted in its full form. Despite this it is clear at the time of writing that<lb/> the manifesto established sky-high stakes for constitutional reform. The CDRC has been<lb/> split up into smaller elements that have not been afforded the column inches that an<lb/> omnibus process might have received. In relation to human rights, the government ran<lb/> two consultations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first, the &apos;Independent Human Rights Act Review&apos; was led by Sir Peter Gross, with a<lb/> final report that emphasised the crucial importance of broadening awareness about<lb/> human rights in order for the public to &apos;own&apos; their rights and to be able to use them. <ref type="biblio">49</ref> The<lb/> second consultation led by Justice Secretary Dominic Raab invited experts to respond to<lb/> a series of proposals which included substantive amendment of human rights law,<lb/> making little reference to Sir Peter Gross&apos; review. <ref type="biblio">50<lb/></ref> It is worth reflecting on this process as it is instructive of the fragility of such &apos;asks&apos; in an<lb/> adverse political environment. The gravitas and expertise of the Independent Human<lb/> Rights Review commissioners could not prevent the government from dropping the vast<lb/> majority of their recommendations, including legal education about human rights. In an<lb/> online event discussing this exchange Sir Gross remarked that the review of human rights<lb/> law should not be premised on the government&apos;s scepticism of a small number of high-<lb/>profile cases, but should be based on a more widespread ownership of rights by citizens. <ref type="biblio">51<lb/></ref> I have argued elsewhere that the CDRC could represent a pivotal opportunity to facilitate<lb/> a society-wide discussion about the future direction of our politics. <ref type="biblio">52</ref> It is not too late for<lb/> the government to conduct a nationwide CDRC that represents the best of the principles<lb/> above; an opportunity for constitutional education accompanied with a concrete<lb/> opportunity to feed back into current government proposals.<lb/></p>

			<p>One example of this model was run by the UCL Constitution Unit in 2021. The Unit<lb/> convened a stratified sample of citizens from across the country and presented them with<lb/> a series of informational presentations by legal and political experts. After these<lb/> presentations the citizens were asked for their views on matters at the heart of the UK<lb/> democracy such as strengthening the role of Parliament in holding the executive to<lb/> account, maintaining the role of the courts in limiting the actions of governments and<lb/> strengthening the code of conduct for MPs and peers. <ref type="biblio">53</ref> These recommendations are very<lb/> different from the aims of the CDRC and thus represent a very important potential<lb/> contribution of citizens to the political discourse.<lb/></p>

			<head>Poor legal capability is undermining Parliamentary intention<lb/></head>

			<p>The most compelling argument in favour of mainstreaming legal capability through PLE<lb/> is that the present situation has the potential to undermine the implementation of rights<lb/> that Parliament confers upon citizens. The Windrush Lessons Learnt Review, an inquiry<lb/> into the mistreatment of Caribbean Britons by the immigration system, recommended<lb/> extensive training for civil servants on the Human Rights Act 1998 and Equality Act 2010,<lb/> finding that senior civil servants were making decisions otherwise than in accordance<lb/> with these legislative instruments despite the existence of a well-known legal framework<lb/> AND adverse court judgements in which their departments had been unsuccessful<lb/> defendants. <ref type="biblio">54<lb/></ref> Throughout 2020, I convened a series of roundtables with senior politicians and civil<lb/> servants to hear from them about how the law could have better protected those affected.<lb/></p>

			<p>The closed &apos;Windrush Roundtables&apos; made clear that the complexity of the rules around<lb/> immigration made it very difficult for those affected to understand their legal position;<lb/> another area in which the government has not provided sufficient clarity as to citizens&apos;<lb/> rights on the one hand, and has made those rights inscrutable on the other.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a literature review of PLE evaluations the author and others found that high-quality<lb/> interventions that combine case work principles with a PLE approach can work well for<lb/> claimants in the social care setting. <ref type="biblio">55</ref> The application of PLE to real-life legal issues<lb/> involving public authorities is somewhat underexplored, but if done successfully it could<lb/> prove transformative in improving access to justice in the public law space and could<lb/> encourage further engagement in developing a rule of law culture across England. <ref type="biblio">56<lb/></ref></p>

 Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>English PLE is at an early point in its implementation. There have been a number of<lb/> highly promising governmental initiatives that have not received sufficient political will<lb/> or resources in order to make legal capability stick. The information distributed to<lb/> influence citizens during the referendum and public health campaigns (e.g. smoking and<lb/> coronavirus) show that the government is capable of disseminating compelling messages;<lb/> choices about resources prevent it from exercising that ability.<lb/> This knowing choice to baulk at recent opportunities to accompany major moments of<lb/> constitutional reform with PLE is distressing. It is problematic because of the scale of<lb/> proposed reform, which will likely take place without most citizens being aware of its<lb/> stark consequences.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although superficial, the author has observed clear cross-party popularity for PLE<lb/> initiatives. Advocates of access to justice can and should continue to pursue increasing<lb/> the legal aid budget in order to assist people with resolving disputes they cannot resolve<lb/> themselves. However PLE should always be on the table whenever we make any<lb/> argument about legal aid funding due to its invigorating effect on the democracy as well<lb/> as the role it serves in bridging warring political ideologies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our advocacy of PLE should be passionate but not uncritical. There is a possibility that<lb/> PLE becomes a neo-liberal political vehicle for the laissez-faire state providing nothing.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">54<lb/></ref> This is an undercurrent I am aware of from my several years advising ministers in this<lb/> area and such an ideology ought to be resisted; we call for increased support and<lb/> expansion of PLE to complement a fully functioning, properly funded legal system.</p>

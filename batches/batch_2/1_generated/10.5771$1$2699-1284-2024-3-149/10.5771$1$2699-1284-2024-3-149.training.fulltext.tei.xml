			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>A key aspect of many Digital Humanities projects is the use of texts as research<lb/> data. Text and Data Mining (TDM) is an umbrella term for a range of methods<lb/> I.<lb/></p>

			<p>role throughout this analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>B. What are derived text formats (DTFs)<lb/></head>

			<p>DTFs have been described as extracted features for non-consumptive research. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> They<lb/> are systematically generated representations of a base text, which allow the application<lb/> II.<lb/></p>

			<p>constraints (this could be the case of some product descriptions or user manuals).<lb/></p>

			<p>Public domain texts can be freely copied and shared, so there is limited practical<lb/> interest in deriving DTFs from them (at least in the context of copyright concerns); but<lb/> since they can also be freely modified, deriving and sharing DTFs from such texts is<lb/> not in any way restricted by copyright law.<lb/></p>

It can be summarised as fol<lb/> lows:<lb/> b)<lb/> the TDM exceptions (see above) provide a much more convenient and secure basis for this activity.<lb/></figure>

			<head>DTF and the integrity right<lb/></head>

			<p>Although rarely discussed in the context of new technologies, moral rights of authors<lb/> should not be absent from the discussion on DTFs. The so-called integrity right is<lb/> recognised by Article 6bis of the Berne Convention. In Germany, it can be found in<lb/> § 14 UrhG. The texts read as follows:<lb/></p>

			<head>Article 6bis(1) of the Berne Convention:<lb/></head>

			<p>(1) Independently of the author&apos;s economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the<lb/> author shall have the right to (...) object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or<lb/> other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or<lb/> reputation.<lb/></p>

			<head>§ 14 UrhG:<lb/></head>

			<p>The author has the right to prohibit the distortion or any other derogatory treatment of his or her<lb/> work which is capable of prejudicing the author&apos;s legitimate intellectual or personal interests in the<lb/> work.<lb/></p>

			<p>It seems possible that some DTFs, in particular Transformative DTFs with shuffled<lb/> of the rightholder or within the scope of a statutory copyright exception.<lb/></p>

			<head>DTFs and the &quot;reconstructability&quot; criterion<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned above, according to the CJEU snippets are to be regarded as partial<lb/> reproductions if they are original or if their &quot;cumulative effect (.</p>

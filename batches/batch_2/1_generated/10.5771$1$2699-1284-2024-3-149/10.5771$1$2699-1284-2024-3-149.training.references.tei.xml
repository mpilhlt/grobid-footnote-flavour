They can be produced in such a way that, on the one hand, the resulting representation still allows for the application of at least one research method, while, on the other hand, the representation is no longer protected by copy right. The basic idea behind DTFs is to selectively remove specific pieces of informa tion, particularly copyright-relevant features, from in-copyright texts to transform copyright-protected material into DTFs which no longer contain copyright-relevant features and therefore, are no longer affected by copyright restrictions. Additionally, if the material cannot be &apos;humanly&apos; read and understood in order to intellectually assimi late its content (Baudry, 2023), 5 making it available to the public is less likely to affect the interests of copyright holders. At the same time, such materials are still suitable for a variety of TDM tasks in the Digital Humanities, such as simple quantification of words and other linguistics features, stylometry and authorship attribution, topic modelling, or the training of machine learning models</title>. <note>There are many ways to create DTFs from source texts, but they can be roughly divided into three groups 6 listed below</note>, <note>with examples for reference</note>.</bibl>
	<bibl>) <note>Statistical DTFs: The first method is to extract textual features from texts</note> (e.g. <title level="a">tokens, lemmata, n-grams, sentences, lines, paragraphs or pages) and their corre sponding statistical information, such as length, absolute/relative frequency or sequence. Such extracted, descriptive information can then be published for text analysis tasks</title>. <title level="a">Examples of such DTFs are the</title> &quot;<title level="j">Hathi Trust Extracted Features</title>&quot; (<note>see e.g., Jett et al. 2020, Organisciak et al. 2017, Parulian et al. 2022) and the</note> &quot;<publisher>Google Books Ngram Datasets</publisher>&quot; (<note>see e.g., Michel et al. 2011, El-Ebshihy et al. 2018, Richey &amp; Taylor 2020</note>).</bibl>

Therefore, It is necessary to take a closer look at the creation process itself before analysing whether the result of the process, the DTF itself, is still protected by copyright. As it will be demonstrated, a distinction can be made between manually and automatically creating DTFs. Manually deriving DTFs Theoretically, one could derive DTFs, especially Statistical DTFs, entirely manually, e.g. by manually counting words, characters, etc., and then presenting the results in a chart or a diagram. Although certainly time-consuming and inefficient in the digital age, manual derivation of Statistical DTFs possibly can be a copyright-irrelevant act, if the source text is not reproduced (copied) in the process, and only pure copyright-free</title> <note>information is extracted from the text (e.g., there are 3 occurrences of the word &quot;kerfuffle&quot; in the text, the text consists of 772 sentences, the most common sentence length is 5 words</note>, etc.). <title level="a">However, this is of course a time-consuming and error-prone copyright-relevant. The wording of Article 2 of the InfoSoc Directive 14 and of § 16(1) UrhG, defining the exclusive right of reproduction, leaves no doubts as to the fact that all acts of reproduction, even technically necessary acts of temporary reproductions</title>, <note>are copy right-relevant: 14 Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, InfoSoc Directive</note>, <ptr type="web">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2001/29/oj</ptr>.</bibl>

Of course, asking for the rightholder&apos;s permission to derive a DTF is not a reasonable option, primarily for pragmatic reasons</title> (e.g., <title level="a">multiple and/DTF, due to the fact that they allow reproductions of entire works. In the context of this deliverable, two of these exceptions deserve a closer look: § 60d UrhG which allows reproductions necessary for TDM for scientific purposes and § 44a UrhG which allows temporary acts of reproduction. Other statutory excep tions, such as § 51 UrhG (citation) or § 53 UrhG (private copy) are too narrow in scope. Even § 60c UrhG which is the specific statutory exception for scientific research, generally only allows reproductions of 15 % of a work, with entire reproduc tions being allowed only in very limited cases (for so-called &quot;small-scale works&quot; or out-of-commerce works)</title>. <title level="a">When interpreting statutory exceptions, the so-called three-step test must be con sidered, before turning to a more detailed examination of the potentially relevant statutory exceptions for creating DTFs</title>. <title level="j">Three-step-test According to Article</title> <biblScope unit="volume">9</biblScope>(<biblScope unit="issue">2</biblScope><title level="a">) of the Berne Convention, signatory countries can adopt exceptions to the reproduction right in their national laws, provided that these excep tions are limited to &quot;certain special cases&quot;, and that the allowed uses</title> &quot;[do] not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and [do] <note>not unreasonably prejudice the legiti mate interests of the author[s]&quot;. This provision, called the &quot;three-step test</note>&quot;, <note>was first introduced during the 1967 revision of the Convention. Today, it can also be found in Article 13 of the TRIPS Agreement, Article 10 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and in Article 5(5) of the InfoSoc Directive</note>.</bibl>

For example, an exception allowing for all works to be used without permission from the rightholder for &quot;personal development&quot; purposes would fail this test, as it is not clearly defined (what exactly is &quot;personal development&quot;? Does it cover only spiritual, or also material enrichment? Whose &quot;personal development&quot; -only the user&apos;s or also his or her public&apos;s?, etc.) and above all it is too broad in scope (not &quot;limited&quot;), as it can mean both &quot;lawful</title>&quot; (<note>i.e., grounded in the law), and, more broadly, &quot;valid&quot; (as in: justifiable, reasonable</note>). <title level="a">It seems that the narrower view, limited to protecting interests enshrined in the law, is more appropriate. Copyright exceptions should not &quot;unreasonably prejudice&quot; such legitimate interest. According to the WTO Panel, this precludes exceptions that cause or may cause &quot;unreasonable loss of income&quot; to the rightholder 15 . However, a contrario, a certain degree of prejudice</title> (&quot;<note>reasonable prejudice</note>&quot;, <note>related to a &quot;reasonable loss of income&quot;) remains acceptable.</note> . <title level="a">As demonstrated, the three-step test offers considerable freedom of interpretation and &quot;sufficient breathing space for social, cultural and economic needs&quot; (Senftleben, 2010) 16 .

In fact, producing a DTF is very similar in nature to applying methods like topic modelling or stylometry, with the exception that the process is not continued as it normally would, i.e. by summarizing the transformed data, by visualizing a selection of the data, and by drawing conclusions from it. Rather, it stops at an earlier phase. This should not be an obstacle to seeing the creation of DTFs as compatible with the legal definition of TDM and the DTF itself as a result of a TDM process. Creating DTFs can be a goal of a TDM process. For example, finding any keyness analysis supposes, in a first step, to collect the frequency and/or dispersion informa tion about all the different words found in a corpus</title>, <note>which is essentially information about how the frequency of a given word evolved over time may require creation of Statistical DTFs.

In such cases, their use (further copying and sharing) would either require permission from rightholders, or it would need to enter within the scope of an existing statutory exception. In both situations, the purpose of a DTF would not be fully achieved. The Court also ruled (also in the Infopaq case) that individual words considered in isolation are not intellectual creations of their authors, and therefore they are not protected by copyright 31 . However, originality of snippets of 11 words (11-grams) extracted from newspaper articles cannot, according to the CJEU, &quot;be ruled out&quot; 32 . One could expect that in Germany, the country of origin of the kleine Münze (small coin) doctrine (under which, briefly put, works that only exhibit a low level of originality can still be protected by copyright) 33 , very short texts would enjoy copyright protection. Indeed, in 1964 the appellate court of Düsseldorf declared a four-word slogan &quot;Ein Himmelbett als Handgepäck&quot; (&apos;A canopy bed as hand luggage&apos;) to be original 34 . This decision is, however, both dated and isolated. More recently, German courts have systematically refused copyright protection for slogans such as</title>: &quot;<note>Für das aufregendste Ereignis des Jahres&quot; (&apos;For the most exciting event of the year&apos;) 35 , &quot;Thalia verführt zum Lesen&quot; (&apos;Thalia tempts into reading&apos;) 36 or</note></bibl>

Eventually, only some of perlentaucher&apos;s summaries that were not distinct enough from the original reviews were found to be infringing.

Prima facie, DTFs could potentially be regarded as compilations, i.e. collections of various elements (original or not) that can be protected by copyright by virtue of the original &quot;selection or arrangement&quot; of those constitutive parts. Typical examples of compilations within the meaning of copyright law include dictionaries, encyclopedias, catalogues, collections of poems, &quot;best of&quot; lists, etc. If the exercised free and creative choices (e.g</title>. &quot;<title level="a">My favorite quotes from Woody Allen&quot;) in the process, the resulting compilation can be original and therefore protected by copyright.

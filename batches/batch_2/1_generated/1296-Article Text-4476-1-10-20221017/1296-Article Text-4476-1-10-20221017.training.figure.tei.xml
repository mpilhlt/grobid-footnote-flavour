            <figDesc>The relationship between Street Law, information literacy and open<lb/> educational practices<lb/> Copyright might, at first glance, feel like an unusual topic for a Street Law activity, it<lb/> being initially associated with the restriction of individual&apos;s rights, and business law.<lb/> Through the diagram above, we have sought to demonstrate that it is in fact a direct<lb/> fit with the social justice mission of clinical legal education. Perhaps, most<lb/> importantly, clinicians need to provide suitable opportunities for the students<lb/> engaging with Street Law projects in this area to see these connections. Ultimately,<lb/> developing information literacy skills in the area of copyright will serve many<lb/> individuals, protect culture and perhaps ultimately support small businesses in the<lb/> </figDesc>

            <figDesc>the standard expected of a &apos;learn by doing&apos; game and concentrate on maintaining and<lb/> building on that standard of work. It is not uncommon to hear Street Law clinicians<lb/> anecdotally describe the difficulties in encouraging students to increase their<lb/> creativity (possibly a hangover from the more formal authoritarian style of<lb/> mainstream legal education). Adapting resources gives students a physical example<lb/> of interactive facilitation, and is a worthwhile activity for students at the start of their<lb/> Street Law course. School teacher Ms Dene, who was based in the classroom with her<lb/> SFS during the session, noted;<lb/> 97<lb/> &quot;The Copyright Card game was brilliant fun! We ran it with our Sixth Form Law<lb/> Scholarship Society. The Queen Mary students ran the competitive game online with<lb/> different rounds, which kept it engaging and exciting. The students had a great time<lb/> and also learnt a lot! For students who were already interested in law, I think they were<lb/> surprised at how little they knew about a strand of law that is so important to their<lb/> everyday lives.&quot;<lb/> Despite being actively encouraged to dissect all the original teaching resources, the<lb/> actual cards were not altered. The pack of cards was stripped back to reduce<lb/> complication and sections added in, but the students felt reluctant to change the<lb/> terminology on the cards. In this respect, Street Law students adapting other resources<lb/> need as much encouragement to change them -perhaps something which comes with<lb/> confidence, experience and demonstration. Just as those leading Street Law teaching,<lb/> model student-centred teaching practice within their own classes; we found that<lb/> students benefit when Street Law teachers model the art of adaptation to them. This<lb/> can easily be achieved through adapting the wealth of Street Law resources readily<lb/> available, running a session and then showing the students the original resource 21 .</figDesc>

            <figDesc>ran a further adaptation experience of Copyright the Card Game, at the Law<lb/> Society of Ireland orientation weekend in October 2021 (a weekend devoted to<lb/> 101<lb/> training trainee solicitors in Ireland to facilitate Street Law sessions in schools). By<lb/> contrast, here it was played with trainee solicitors who were learning about Street<lb/> Law. The game was played to demonstrate to them the art of adaptation and the link<lb/> between copyright and social justice. At the end of playing a significantly paired<lb/> down and compressed version of the game (partly due to time constraints), the<lb/> trainees were asked how copyright links with social justice issues. All the comments<lb/> were related to the right to protect your own work from abuse and exploitation. As a<lb/> twist, trainees were then shown a trailer for Paywall the Movie<lb/> (https://paywallthemovie.com/trailers 25 ) which is an open access documentary<lb/> highlighting the issues of academic writing (especially those coming from publicly<lb/> funded universities) being kept behind expensive paywalls and how this impacts on<lb/> society&apos;s ability to innovate -particularly with medical advances 26 . This additional<lb/> adaptation to the game further emphasised how it is about the discussion of legal<lb/> issues in society rather than participants of the game developing an intricate<lb/> knowledge of copyright law.<lb/> Giving it a Go<lb/> This article aims to inspire you to think about a broad range of topic areas for Street<lb/> Law projects and the social justice benefit in widening awareness about copyright,<lb/> especially in a post Covid19 world. Perhaps most importantly, we hope this article<lb/> will inspire you to think about how you can design Street Law projects which adapt<lb/> and develop already available open educational resources. For those looking for<lb/> existing open educational resources there are numerous collections online, but we<lb/> recommend the University of Edinburgh&apos;s guide to finding suitable resources. 27 When<lb/> re-using or re-purposes educational resources students need to be mindful of any<lb/> financial implications, copyright restrictions on any resources and of course ensuring<lb/> that they are jurisdiction appropriate. The key advantage of open educational<lb/> resources is that they are by definition free and openly licensed so can be freely reused<lb/> and adapted subject to the specific Creative Commons licence. However introducing<lb/> students to these resources can ultimately help them to focus the time they do have<lb/> on producing a better final Street Law session. As clinical legal education academics,<lb/> we must at all times remember the importance of the process on Street Law student<lb/> learning. How can we turn the art of adaption into learning rather than being viewed<lb/> (rightly or wrongly) by Law students as being a short cut to the final product.<lb/> Outside of the UK, Street Law students are perhaps more accustomed to working with<lb/> templates or adapting materials through the work of Street Law, Inc. 28 (providing<lb/> materials for use in the USA) and books like Democracy for all: education towards a<lb/> democratic culture by David McQuoid-Mason. 29 In clinical legal education, we strive<lb/> to develop innovative graduates who think and behave differently; we hope that this<lb/> article has encouraged you to consider teaching Street Law students about open<lb/> educational practices and Creative Commons materials, as well as the art of adapting.</figDesc>

	<div type="abstract">The Oscar Chinn Case, U.K. v. Belgium, Award, 12 December 1934 (hereafter re-<lb/>ferred to as Oscar Chinn), PCIJ Rep. Series A/B, No. 63, 88: "No enterprise […] can<lb/> escape from the chances and hazards resulting from general economic conditions.<lb/> Some industries may be able to make large profits during a period of general prosper-<lb/>ity, or else by taking advantage of a treaty of commerce or of an alteration in customs<lb/> duties; but they are also exposed to the danger of ruin or extinction if circumstances<lb/> change. Where this is the case, no vested rights are violated by the State."; Starrett<lb/> Housing Corp. v. Iran, 4 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Rep. (1983), 156: (hereafter re-<lb/>ferred to as Starrett Housing) "Investors in Iran, like investors in all other countries,<lb/> have to assume a risk that the country might experience strikes, lock-outs, distur-<lb/>bances, changes of economic and political system and even revolution. That any of<lb/> these risks materialised does not necessarily mean that property rights affected by<lb/> such events can be deemed to have been taken." Feldman, supra note 15, para. 112:<lb/> "Governments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and<lb/> regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing political,<lb/> economic or social considerations. Those changes may well make certain activities<lb/> less profitable or even uneconomic to continue […]".</div>

	<div type="abstract">For example, Article 113 of the Tax Code, No. 146-FZ, dated 31 July 1998 (as effec-<lb/>tive on the date when the Yukos Decision of the Constitutional Court was passed),<lb/> stated that "a person cannot be held liable for a tax offense if three years (the statute of<lb/> limitations) have expired since the day when the offense was committed or since the<lb/> first day after the end of the tax period during which the offense committed." (this Ar-<lb/>ticle of the Tax Code was amended on 27 July 2006). In the Yukos Decision of the<lb/> Constitutional Court, No. 36-O, dated 18 January 2005, the Court re-interpreted this<lb/> provision to apply only for "conscientious" taxpayers. It was deemed not to apply to<lb/> "un-conscientious" taxpayers, which Yukos was found to be. However, the wording of<lb/> the statute does not actually provide a basis for this interpretation.</div>

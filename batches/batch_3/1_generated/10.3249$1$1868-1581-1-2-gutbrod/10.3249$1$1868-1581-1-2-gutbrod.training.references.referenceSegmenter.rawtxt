Protection against Indirect Expropriation 

293 

Introduction 

In recent years, direct expropriation 2 has rarely been seen. 3 States 
which wish to import capital do not like to be associated with posing a per-
manent, non-calculable threat to foreign-owned property but prefer to pre-
sent themselves as jurisdictions with very stable, reliable and orderly regula-
tory environments. 4 Expropriation, however, has by no means vanished; its 
execution has just become more subtle. 5 Ambiguously or generously 

2 

In a nutshell, direct expropriation is the compulsory transfer of legal title or the out-
right seizure of property by the State. In contrast, indirect expropriation refers to the 
situation in which the investor formally remains legal owner. See, instead of all,

worded laws are 'interpreted' in a way that suits certain groups in the gov-
ernment or are only enforced when it suits a particular interest; administra-
tive discretion is influenced by factors unrelated to the matter at issue, or 
administrations fail to conduct their processes in a transparent and compre-
hensible way. All these measures, turned against a foreign investor, can eas-
ily drive him out of business. Virtually all bilateral investment treaties 
(BITs) and multilateral investment agreements (MITs), therefore, reflect this 
development and also cover acts of State which may expropriate "indirectly 
through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalisation" 6 (indirect 
expropriation 7 ). Moreover, many international investment agreements (IIAs)

From an analytical point of view, one can distinguish between "creeping" and "conse-
quential expropriation". "'Creeping' expropriation is comprised out of a number of 
elements, none of which can -separately -constitute the international wrong." Reis-
man & Sloane, supra note 3, 123, 125-127. Intention to harm the investment or the 
investor or an intention to expropriate is not necessary but helps to prove a creeping

not only provide rules on (indirect) expropriation but also establish so-called 
treatment standards "which refer to the legal regime that applies to invest-
ments once they have been admitted by the host State." 8 Administrative 
malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance may also affect the investment 
adversely without amounting to "indirect expropriation", constituting a less 
intense interference with the property. Indeed, there are arbitral awards 
which, while not accepting a claim based on "indirect expropriation", estab-
lished a compensable violation of "treatment standards", i.e. in particular the 
"fair and equitable treatment" embodied in BITs or MITs. 9

quential expropriation" refers to the situation in which the host State fails to properly 
create, maintain and manage "the legal, administrative, and regulatory normative 
framework contemplated by the relevant BIT, an indispensable feature of the 'favour-
able conditions' for investment." Reisman & Sloane, supra note 3, 129, 130. Here, 
also, an intention on the part of the host State is not required. Reisman & Sloane, su-

This article will look at six typically posed challenges to foreign in-
vestment posed by administrative acts, focusing on the issues of discrimina-
tion, mala fide and lack of transparency, and will discuss the response of 
national and international rules applicable to the situation of indirect expro-
priation. 10 These scenarios are based on Russian legal regulations 11 and are 
inspired by the events in the Commonwealth of Independent States reality 
but by no means intend to be a reflection of facts. 
We will show that the internal legal order cannot respond to any of 
these challenges through striking a just balance between legitimate business 
interests of the foreign investor and the State's sovereign right to regulate. 
Rather, it is the international (contractual) law on foreign investment which 
offers the clearly more sophisticated framework for a balanced settlement of 
a foreign investment dispute. Our prediction is that if economies in transi-
tion, like Russia, do not start living up to the standards required by interna-
tional investment agreements quickly, they might face the risk of the mar-
ginalization of their national legal orders in the settlement of foreign in-
vestment disputes. Such conflicts, which earlier clearly had an "internal 
component", would increasingly become international only and would, in 
this sense, be externalized. 

Socialist Republics concerning the promotion and reciprocal protection of invest-
ments, signed 6 April 1989, entered into force 3 July 1991. In academic writing, much 
effort has been spent on the question of whether and how the concepts of "fair and eq-
uitable treatment", "full protection and security" and "non-discrimination" are to be 
delimited from each other. 

10 

Occasionally, if it is helpful in making an argument more explicit, we might also make 
reference to the concept of "fair and equitable treatment", part of the treatment stan-
dards attributable to a foreign investment by virtue of IIAs. 

11 

Russia, like many countries around the world, has become party to a variety of bilat-
eral and multilateral international agreements (at least partly) concerned with or re-
lated to the protection of foreign investment, i.e. numerous bilateral investment trea-
ties (BITs) with all major capital exporting countries (Russia had signed 56 BITs as of 
1 June 2005, of which 30 had entered into force; for a detailed list, see the UNCTAD

Protection against Indirect Expropriation 

297 

This article will start off by providing a brief survey of the present 
discussion in the literature based on the awards rendered on the subject, on 
what constitutes a compensable taking in international law (Section A.). It 
will then turn to certain hypothetical situations (Section B.). These are split 
into two parts: the first four scenarios deal with State measures which are 
lawful by national standards (Section B.I.) and the last two scenarios focus 
on State measures which are unlawful even by national standards (Section 
B.II.). Finally, it summarizes and evaluates our findings. 

A. Identifying a Compensable Taking -A Brief Sum-
mary of the Present Discussion 

Above, we referred to the 'subtle' governmental interference with for-
eign property. However, what are those 'subtle' measures 'tantamount to 
expropriation' which will eventually give rise to compensation? 
It has been suggested that the phrase 'tantamount to expropriation' 
does not only refer to intentional or obvious indirect expropriation but that 
"[i]t also captures the multiplicity of inappropriate regulatory acts, omis-
sions, and other deleterious conduct that undermines the vital normative 
framework created and maintained by BITs". 12 Recalling the objectives pur-
sued by entering into BITs and similar agreements -the establishment and 
maintenance of a "healthy investment climate" 13 -the concept of 'indirect 

12 

13 

Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, available at 
www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treaties.htm (last visited 11 August 2005), asks to have due 
regard to the object and purpose in the construction of a treaty. Most, if not all, BITs, 
as well as multinational agreements on investment protection such as the European 
Energy Treaty or the NAFTA, intend, as provided for in their preambles, to establish 
favourable conditions for investment by nationals and companies of one State in the 
territory of the other State. For a review of typical preambles, see Dolzer &Stevens, 
supra note 8, 20-21. In short, they envisage a "healthy investment climate" which is 
conditio sine qua non for the attraction of foreign direct investment. Those treaties 
"contemplate […] an effective normative framework: impartial courts, an efficient and 
legally restrained bureaucracy, and the measure of transparency in decision"; Reisman 
& Sloane, supra note 3, 117. If a State signs up to such a treaty, it must be aware that 
it not only opens its doors to foreign investment but also commits itself to establish 
and/or maintain an appropriate legal, administrative, and regulatory framework; 

GoJIL 1 (2009) 2, 291-327 

298 

expropriation' is extended to "an egregious failure to create or maintain the 
normative 'favourable conditions' in the host state". 14 
However, not every governmental adjustment of the normative 
framework or change in the application of this framework, or even mistake 
in application -errare humanum est -that adversely affects the economies 
where a foreign investment is made constitutes an expropriatory act (or a 
violation of treatment standards): 15 

"[S]tate measures, prima facie a lawful exercise of powers of 
governments, may affect foreign interests considerably without 
amounting to expropriation. Thus, foreign assets and their use 
may be subjected to taxation, trade restrictions involving li-
censes and quotas, or measures of devaluation. While special 
facts may alter cases, in principle such measures are not unlaw-
ful and do not constitute expropriation." 16 

Reisman & Sloane, supra note 3, 117; undecided, Dolzer, supra note 12, 73-74. See, 
for such an approach, Kuwait v. American Independent Oil Co. (Aminoil), Final 
Award, 24 May 1982 (hereafter referred to as Aminoil), 21 ILM (1982), 976, at para. 
147; Mondev Int'l Ltd v. United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, 
Award, 11 October 2002, 42 ILM (2003), 110, para. 127. Some may argue now that an 
investment treaty is intended to benefit both investor and host State and that, thus, the 
rights and obligations of both sides need to be recognized; see Dolzer, who stipulates 
this question at Dolzer, supra, 74. As much as this is true, this argument does not 
speak against the aforementioned. It must be stressed again that BITs and MITs are 
not intended to prohibit legitimate regulatory measures by the host State. On the con-
trary, they encourage the host State to exercise its regulatory powers in a transparent, 
non-discriminating, non-abusive way guided by reason and the rule of law, at least 
towards the foreign investor. In doing so, the host State is maintaining a "healthy in-
vestment climate" which, as already said, is essential for the attraction of foreign capi-
tal. The establishment of such a administrative framework will, ultimately, lead to an 
improvement of the overall governance standards in the host State.

In other words, doing business means taking advantage of opportuni-
ties while accepting certain risks. Opportunities, or in other words, "favour-
able business conditions and goodwill, are transient circumstances, subject 
to inevitable change." 17 Thus, the materialization of a risk ordinarily related 
to a business venture does not amount to an expropriation. 18 It is necessary 
to distinguish between the legitimate interest in adjusting and executing 
national policies and the abuse of sovereign powers through illegitimate 
interferences in foreign investment activities which are tantamount to ex-
propriation. 19 
International tribunals, arbitration courts, jurists and scholars "have 
increasingly accepted that expropriation must be analysed in consequential 
rather than formal terms," 20 and no single, clear-cut test has emerged so far

to determine whether an indirect expropriation has taken place. 21 Indeed, it 
seems that the organic and slow "common law method of case-by-case de-
velopment is pre-eminently the best method, in fact probably the only me-
thod, of legal development" 22 in this field. The discussion surrounding three 
important factors which have emerged from this process deserve to be men-
tioned here. 
The severity of the impact on the owner's legal status, namely the 
ability to use, enjoy, control and freely dispose of his investment, has been 
accepted as a central factor in drawing the dividing line between expropria-
tion and legitimate administrative regulation. 23 Importantly, however, it is 
controversial whether this severity is the sole/predominant factor 24 or 
merely one of several important factors. 25 There is case law supporting both 

supra note 3, 121. A wide range of State measures may be interpreted as expropriatory 
if those measures significantly reduce the value of the property rights of an investor or 
render them useless; see Reisman & Sloane, supra note 3, 123.

U.S. C.T.R. (1984), 225-226; Starrett Housing, supra note 17, 154; Phelps Dodge

law, refer to AlQurashi, supra note 22, 907-909 and Dolzer, supra note 12, 86-90.

Another strand of case law suggests that there are more factors to be taken into con-
sideration: Oscar Chinn, supra note 17, 88. See also T. Weiler, 'Saving Oscar Chinn:

views. 26 In this article, we follow the school of thought that determining 
indirect expropriation only by diminution in property value might reduce 
national policy space to zero as governments would then be confronted with 
claims for compensation any time they change policy; 27 and this would limit 
international law on foreign investment to an insurance policy against bad 
business decisions. 28 We will proceed, therefore, from the assumption that 
the impact of the State measure is a central but not the sole factor. 
The degree of interference with property rights which is necessary in 
order to hold a State liable for indirect expropriation is also controversial. 29 
Again, two strands of case law have emerged. One line of case law, basi-
cally as evidenced by decisions of the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR), 30 requires that property rights have been rendered totally valueless, 
i.e. the investor has been definitely and fully deprived of the ownership of 
his property, 31 while more moderate authorities demand a significant or sub-

presented case law, refer to AlQurashi, supra note 22, 909-911, Dolzer, supra note 
12, 81-86. 

26 

Dolzer points at the weakness of the "sole effect doctrine", stating that "the propo-
nents of the 'sole effect doctrine' would have to explain why international law protect-
ing aliens should require a higher standard of protection than the major domestic legal 
orders"; Dolzer, supra note 12, 91.

stantial interference with the property rights. 32 The ECHR leaves the State a 
rather wide "margin of appreciation" in the implementation of their domes-
tic laws and regulations referring to expropriation. 33 However, this strand of 
case law should not be over-emphasized; nor should it have "authoritative" 
impact on the determination of indirect expropriation outside the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Free-
doms, 34 as the Convention and its First Protocol 35 aim to set minimum stan-
dards for the protection of fundamental rights 36 and are not an investment 
protection agreement and, therefore, do not intend to establish "a healthy 
investment climate" -in other words, an elevated standard for the protection 
of property -as BITs and MITs do. In the context of the latter, there is a 
stronger emphasis on the protection of the legitimate interests of a foreign 
investor. Therefore, this article proceeds from the assumption that a signifi-
cant or substantial interference with property rights, i.e. a significant reduc-
tion of value, is sufficient for the establishment of an indirect expropriation 

198, which stated that a detrimental effect on the economic value of property is not 
sufficient to constitute an expropriation.

if the other criteria are met: first and foremost, the effect of the State meas-
ure on the legitimate expectations of the investor; and the nature of the gov-
ernmental action. 
Finally, as just mentioned, an important factor to be taken into consid-
eration is the nature, i.e. the purpose and context, of the governmental ac-
tion. This issue directs our attention towards the question of whether the 
State measure affecting the property rights of the foreign investor promotes 
a recognized social purpose or the general welfare, e.g. public health, safety, 
the rule of law, morals or welfare, etc., and whether it is carried out taking 
due account of the legitimate expectations of the investor 37 with a non-

"Investors are ready, and can be expected to be ready, to accept the regulatory regime 
in situations in which they invest [because they are in the position to make a 
risk/reward assessment of their investment]. Investment protection rather turns around 
the issues of unexpected changes with an excessive detrimental impact on the foreign 
investor's prior calculation." Wälde & Kolo, supra note 19, 819. Courts, tribunals [cf. 
Aminoil, supra note 12, 1034; Phillips Petroleum Co. Iran v. Iran, 21 Iran-U.S.

Also, the ECHR has relied on this concept; see the ECHR cases quoted by Dolzer, su-
pra note 33, 78-79, and commentators cf. e.g. AlQurashi, supra note 22, 913; see also 
Wälde & Kolo, supra note 19, 821 et seq., who want to rely heavily on jurisprudence 
of the U.S. Supreme Court] have frequently referred to the interpretative factor of the 
"disappointment of legitimate expectations". In order to distinguish regulation from 
indirect expropriation, one has to ask whether the State has frustrated the legitimate 
expectations of the investor based on representations and actions of the host State. In 
order to do so, one must base one's evaluation on the facts, taking into account all as-
pects of the specific case at hand. Not only contractual commitments formalize legiti-
mate expectations but also formal governmental promises in treaties, laws and even 
investment brochures do so. See A. A. Fatouros, Government Guarantees to Foreign 
Investors (1962), 69 et seq.; more critical: Sornarajah, supra note 1, 100 et seq.; just 
recently, M. W. Reisman & M. H. Arsanjani, 'The Question of Unilateral Governmen-
tal Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes', 19 ICSID Review (2004), 
328-343, which lacks, however, a dogmatic explanation of how a State can bind itself 
by unilateral statement -despite its value as evidence for the creation of legitimate ex-
pectations within the concept of indirect expropriation or fair and equitable treatment -
in international law towards an investor which is very often not a subject of interna-
tional law; see also Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. and Southern Pa-
cific Properties Ltd (Hong Kong) v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No.

discriminatory, 38 non-protectionist, 39 transparent, bona fide attitude advanc-
ing legitimate State interests. A State measure advances "the common good" 
if it pursues a legitimate purpose, is necessary and proportionate. 40 How-
ever, even a legitimate, non-discriminatory regulation might require com-
pensation if an individual investor is required to make a special sacrifice, i.e. 
giving up legitimate expectations for enjoying his investment-backed prop-
erty, for the benefit of the society at large. 41 

referred to as Southern Pacific Properties), excerpts of the Decision published in 
16 Yearbook Commercial Arbitration (1991), 28, para. 46. This concept allows, 
firstly, to focus on the legal situation in the host State at the time when the investment 
is placed in that country. Secondly, it contains the idea that an expectation deserves 
more protection as it is increasingly backed by investment and, thirdly, it harbours an 
element of flexibility, i.e. legitimate expectations may fade in time and there may be a 
change of priorities in the host society; Dolzer, supra note 33, 78-79. 

38 

"[A]ny taking that is pursuant to discriminatory or arbitrary action, or any action that 
is without legitimate justification, is considered to be contrary to the non-
discrimination requirement, even absent any singling-out on the basis of nationality. 
This includes prohibition of discrimination with regard to due process and payment of 
compensation requirements. Moreover, the non-discrimination requirement demands 
that governmental measures, procedures and practices be non-discriminatory even in 
the treatment of members of the same group of aliens." UNCTAD, International In-
vestment Agreements: Key Issues, Vol. 1, 2004, 239. That also means that in order to 
fall foul of the non-discrimination rule it is not required that the host State discrimi-
nates explicitly and formally against the foreign investor; it is sufficient that the State 
measure is discriminatory in its effect. For the application of this notion in recent 
NAFTA awards, refer to S. D. Myers, supra note 24, para. 308. See also Wälde & 
Kolo, supra note 19, 835-837. For an older notion of discrimination and the general 
problem of its application, consult W. McKean, Equality and Discrimination under 
International Law (1983); E. W. Vierdag, The Concept of Discrimination in Interna-
tional Law (1973).

It is no easy task to establish the "intention" of a government. However, "formal 
statements of the responsible Minister or a series of circumstances pointing to the pro-
tectionist intent being the main motivator for a policy can be taken to indicate the 'in-
tention'"; Wälde & Kolo, supra note 19, 826, footnote 66. See especially the First Par-
tial Award, paras 171-195 and the separate Concurring Opinion of B. Schwartz, 
paras 62-63, in S. D. Myers.

law but is also known to the U.S. legal order; refer to Monogahela Navigation Corp. 
v. U.S., 148 US (1893), 312. Its underlying principle is discrimination, but it goes be-

As mentioned before, as long as a government exercises its adminis-
trative powers in a transparent, non-discriminatory and lawful way with 
beneficial intentions, negative effects on a foreign investment, legal or ille-
gal, are unlikely to be remediable. Rather, they are the result of the changing 
business conditions inevitably linked to any business venture. Departing 
from this unlikely ideal world, we turn our attention to the first of our six 
scenarios. 
Under Russian law, raw materials and subsoil resources are the prop-
erty of the State. 42 However, Russian law provides for the right of a third 
party to acquire such assets. 43 A mining licence is the legal instrument 
which is used to acquire title to a good that is being extracted from under-
ground. Due to its importance and special nature, a mining licence is typi-
cally acquired through a tender. One of the major criteria for decision under 
the tender regime is the minimal amount to be extracted ("Minimal 
Amount") for the purpose of ensuring the efficient use of subsoil re-
sources. 44 However, in many cases, the Minimal Amounts are not matched 
in practice. Also, formal violations of law reportedly take place frequently; 

ing the latter from shifting the costs of regulation to the former; see, Wälde & Kolo, 
supra note 19, 845. The authors of this article are aware of the fact that it is critical to 
derive principles on indirect expropriation from cases decided in national fora, at least 
if one draws heavily only on the case law developed in one single nation (Wälde and 
Kolo indeed do so, arguing that U.S. law, as the law of the last hegemonic power, en-
joys extra authority; Wälde & Kolo, supra note 19, 821-822, even if it might be the 
most powerful nation at present. One must consider these national principles, but as 
part of a comparative study of the rules developed in other major jurisdictions. This 
approach would be in conformity with the teaching on the sources of international law 
in regard to the "general principles of law" embodied in Article 38 of the Statute of 
the ICJ; Dolzer, supra note 12, 69,76-78.

that is, there are minor procedural deviations from the way the licence is to 
be issued, for instance the signatures on the licence are not being made on 
the document as anticipated by legislation. 45 
In our first scenario, a number of investors receive a mining licence. 
The mining licence of one of these investors is withdrawn because of non-
compliance with the terms of the licence (Minimum Amounts) and due to 
formal violations of the rules on licence issuance at the time of the granting 
of the licence. As a consequence of the withdrawal, he goes bankrupt. Under 
similar conditions, other investors' licences remain intact. 

a) Russian Law 

Under the Subsoil Law, the licensing authority is entitled to withdraw 
the licence provided that the conditions for doing so are set out in law. 46 
However, in accordance with Articles 20 and 50 of the Subsoil Law, a licen-
see has the right to challenge the licence withdrawal in court. A licence is 
seen as an act undertaken by the administration. 47 Thus, the rules established 
by the Arbitration Procedure Code of the Russian Federation for challenging 
administrative acts (including appealing rules) 48 have been applied. Cur-
rently, there is no body of legislation or theory in Russia which would give 
guidance to public authorities when deciding upon cases dealt with by ad-
ministrative bodies; 49 in particular, there is no theory of due process. 50 As a

For example, the term is only mentioned in Article 4(11) of Federal Law No. 164 -
FZ, 8 December 2003 "On the Fundamental Principles of the State Regulation of For-
eign Trade Activity": "[…] the basic principles of the state regulation of foreign trade 
activity shall be: […] ensuring the right to appeal, either in due process of law or in 
accordance with any other procedure prescribed under the law, against any illegal ac-
tions (inaction) of governmental agencies and their officials and also the right to chal-
lenge regulatory legal acts of the Russian Federation, derogating from the right of a 
participant in foreign trade activity to conduct such foreign trade activity." (emphasis 
added). 

Protection against Indirect Expropriation

consequence, from the perspective of the holder of a licence, there is no 
body of doctrine he could rely upon when his licence is revoked. 51 In par-
ticular, there is no basis in theory to support the argument that purely formal 
violations of the conditions of licensing that have no material consequences 
cannot lead to the withdrawal of a licence, and the general view is that the 
revocation for such formal reasons is lawful. 
The argument that other investors in similar situations would not have 
their licences withdrawn would also not be heard in any of the proceedings. 
Whilst there is a general prohibition of discrimination under the Russian 
Constitution, this has not been implemented in procedural law up to now. 
Turning to the possibility of proceedings before the Constitutional 
Court, due to the very complicated procedures, rules, and reasons for initia-
tion of proceedings by the Russian Constitutional Court, it is unlikely to 
hear the case, although sometimes decisions of the Russian Constitutional 
Court are unexpected and do not clearly follow established rules. 
Furthermore, a licence is not deemed to be a property right. 52 The fact 
that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company when it has a 
licence would suggest that, if the licence is looked at from an economic per-
spective, it has a value and therefore is a property right or at least is to be 
treated as a property right. Nevertheless, in the commentaries 53 to the Rus-
sian Constitution, licences in general and mining licences in particular are 
not mentioned as potentially being property rights, and in the few deci-

52 

For instance, the relevant statutes in Article 2 of the Law "About licensing of different 
kinds of activity", No. 128-FZ, dated 8 August 2001, give no indications in regard to 
the existence of characteristics resembling property rights: possession, use and dis-
posal. In addition, the term "property right" itself is not mentioned.

sions 54 concerning the withdrawals of mining licences, the argument that a 
licence could be a property right has not played any role. 55 
Moreover, whilst under the Constitution 56 international contracts and 
maybe even custom would have precedence over national law, 57 this has 
never, to the best of our knowledge, led to issues of due process (according 
to international standards) or discrimination being discussed in Russian 
courts. 58 
In summary, the investor is unlikely to succeed with his claim in Rus-
sian courts. 

54 

Reportedly, there have been only a few instances in which mining licences have actu-
ally been withdrawn. Even in the context of what has often been described in the press 
as a crusade against Yukos, Yukos has not actually lost any of the mining licences 
which reportedly violated mining legislation.

Virtually all Russian authors dealing with issues of the application of international 
treaties in the Russian Federation ground their positions on Article 15(4) of the Con-
stitution of the Russian Federation, which states that "[t]he universally-recognized 
norms of international law and international treaties and agreements of the Russian 
Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an international treaty or 
agreement of the Russian Federation fixes rules other than those envisaged by law, the 
rules of the international agreement shall be applied." See www.constitution.ru/en/ 
10003000-02.htm (last visited 8 April 2009). 

57 

See, for instance, T. N. Neshatayeva, International Civil Procedure (2001), 46: "A 
question on the norms of jus cogens character, which mostly exist in the form of cus-
tom has already been touched upon. Considering these norms as principal ones appar-
ently witnesses that the widest application of them is possible in the practice of the RF 
Constitutional Court […]. It is possible to assume that the priority of the interpretation 
of jus cogens norms (norms-principles) by the RF Constitutional Court is a feasible 
approach to this question for Russian judicial practice in general […] The issue be-
comes more complicated when it concerns other international legal norms of custom-
ary origin. Article 15 of the RF Constitution, and later Article 7 of the RF Civil Code 
included the norms of this type (the universally-recognized norms of international 
law) into the Russian legal system. But their place in the system is less clear in com-
parison to treaties […]. While hearing economical disputes in Arbitrazh Courts one 
can already meet participants' references to well-known international norms of cus-
tomary character. First of all, this is true for the substantive norms contained in widely 
known international conventions which are not mandatory for the Russian Federation 
[…]. At this time courts are extremely cautious in appraisal of the procedural norms of 
those conventions that are not in force for Russia yet." 

58 

The foreign investor's licence, 59 but not those of his competitors, irre-
spective of whether they are nationals of the host country or other foreign 
investors, is revoked (i) due to his non-compliance with the terms of issu-
ance and (ii) due to formal deficiencies with the licence. This scenario 
clearly raises the issue of discrimination, which we will focus on here. 
As aforementioned, the non-discrimination requirement in the event of 
indirect expropriation "demands that governmental measures, procedures 
and practices be non-discriminatory even in the treatment of members of the 
same group of aliens." 60 It is apparent that this is not the case here. In spite 
of this, one may argue in favour of the State that the government is "merely" 
enforcing the law, in other words serving the rule of law when revoking a 
defective licence whose issuance terms were not followed by the investor. 
Regarding the "non-compliance with the terms of the licence," under 
international law the investor certainly has no legal right to have his licence 
be held valid if he does not act in conformity with its terms. He was aware 
of the terms at the moment of receipt and could not have had any legitimate 
expectations that an illegal situation would be tolerated. A single investor or 
a group of investors within a larger grouping of investors in a similar situa-
tion may have conducted their business not in compliance with the licence 
conditions and, therefore, also not in compliance with the law; but even if 
this is tolerated by the administration for some time, the investors cannot 
rely on continued toleration of the illegal situation. The same applies to an 
investor whose illegal conduct of business was not tolerated right from the 
beginning. He cannot claim to be discriminated against simply because he 
was being treated in compliance with the law. Any other finding would be 
clearly against the rule of law and the principle of legality (Legalitätsprin-
zip). Likewise, if the administration changes its internal practice in general 
in regard to the application of administrative discretion after it learns about 
the illegality and begins to apply the law properly, then of course there is no

expectation which deserves to be protected. A government must have the 
right to return to a state of legality. 61 
This principle was correctly applied in the Estonian Bank Licence case 
(Genin (U.S.A.) v. Estonia) 62 The Central Bank of Estonia cancelled the 
bank licence of the claimant in conformity with the Estonian Banking 
Code 63 due to the Claimant's severe violations. The Tribunal rejected the 
claim for compensation due to the fact that the Central Bank of Estonia had 
carried out its supervision duty in full compliance with the law, non-
arbitrarily, and without discrimination; and in doing so, the Tribunal bal-
anced the procedural conduct of the government and the (illegal) conduct of 
the investor. 
However, one must ask whether the same reasoning can be applied if 
the government fails generally to enforce a certain law -which it was 
obliged to do without any discretion and was able to enforce -when it just 
picks one out of a group of investors in a similar (illegal) situation and sud-
denly enforces the given law only against this one particular investor, while 
claiming to serve the rule of law? We do not think so. 64 If a statute fails to 
create its intended "equal treatment" generally by systematic illegal execu-
tion 65 of the law, then the proper application in one or a few instances would 
constitute a violation of the non-discrimination requirement. Equality under 
the law means first and foremost equal application of it. 66 Even if the inves-
tor is not entitled to demand treatment which is against the law, he has the 
right to demand that the State not apply the law in his case differently from

Even if a revocation of a licence is well justified, the State must act with procedural 
regularity; otherwise, it would be held liable to pay compensation. In Middle Eastern 
Cement Shipping and Metalclad, the host State was not held liable for the cancellation 
of the licence but for a lack of due process, especially for a lack of transparency.

in Wrong? The Issue of Equality in a State of Illegality', 7 Journal of World Invest-

This means that the investor should be able to demonstrate that the State, in respect to 
the other instances, was not acting due to ignorance of these instances or legal obsta-
cles which would bar it from enforcing the law in question but due to reasons unre-
lated to the aforementioned.

how it applies it in other cases. 67 Thus, the investor has the right to be pro-
tected from the burden of an application of a previously unenforced law as 
long as the State does not return to a state of legality in all similar cases. 68 In 
order to avoid abusing the argument regarding intentions to return to a state 
of legality, which is in principle the obligation of the host State, the host 
State must demonstrate that it enforces the given law now in all situations 
similar to that of the investor. If a host State lacks the capabilities to handle 
all cases at once, it must demonstrate that the enforcement of a given law 
against the investor is the first instance in a uniform conceptual approach 
towards the state of legality. 69 
With regard to our scenario, this would mean that the State should be 
barred from pleading that it serves the principle of legality as long as it fails 
to demonstrate that it is truly returning to a state of legality. 70 Thus, the 
treatment of the investor must be characterized as arbitrary, discriminatory 
and exposing him to sectional prejudice. The investor "expects the State to 
use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the in-
vestment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instru-
ments." 71 
The answer to the question of whether a revocation of the licence on 
the grounds of a "formal violation" of the law on licence issuance is subject 
to the provisions of the IIAs on indirect expropriation depends, firstly, on 
whether the investor was able to remedy this revocation immediately at the 
moment of announcement. If he, however, did not do so due to the fact that 
the rules on licence issuance lacked clarity or were contradictory, then those 
formal defects should not destroy the investor's legitimate expectations for 

67 

It is important to note that this observation applies only to the situation in which the 
State is obliged by law to interfere with a right of an investor in a certain way without 
any discretion but does so only on a selective basis. This is not to be confused with the 
notion of "no equality in wrong" (keine Gleichheit im Unrecht), in German constitu-
tional doctrine. For the distinction -a detailed outline would go beyond the scope of 
this article -refer to C. Kölbel, Gleichheit "im Unrecht" (1998). 

68 

Id., 80, especially p. 141 (English summary); an argument stating that the principle of 
legality demands the immediate proper execution of the law in question against the 
investor implies that the principle of legality takes precedence of the principle of 
equality. This is doubtful. The principle of legality carries inherently the demand of 
due application of the principle of equality; Id., 43, 83.

Key Issues', 1 Transnational Dispute Management (2004) 2; available at: 
www.transnational-dispute-management.com (last visited 11 August 2005). The con-
cept of transparency arrived late in international investment law. In regard to the stan-
dard of treatment, two cases deserve to be mentioned. In Metalclad, supra note, 23, 
para. 76, the NAFTA Tribunal defined the concept of transparency (stated in Article 
1802 NAFTA) as requiring the following: "[…] all relevant legal requirements for the 
purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or in-
tended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known to 
all affected investors of another Party." If a State becomes aware of "confusion or 
misunderstanding" among investors concerning the legal requirements to be fulfilled, 
the Party would have "the duty to ensure that the correct position [would be] promptly 
determined and clearly stated so that the investors can proceed with all appropriate 
expedition in the confident belief that they are acting in accordance with all relevant 
laws" (summary taken from OECD, Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in Inter-
national Law, Working Papers on International Investment, No. 2004/3, 37). Since 
Mexico had failed to provide such a framework, it was held liable for breach of the 
fair and equitable treatment standard. However, this reading was rejected in a review 
by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the grounds that the treaty obligation of 
transparency was outside Chapter Eleven and, thus, outside the fair and equitable 
treatment standard. Moreover, the NAFTA Tribunal was charged to have failed to 
have put forward any evidence that the obligation of transparency has become cus-
tomary international law. Also, in Maffezini, a lack of transparency in administrative 
conduct was established, which led the Tribunal, in connection with other factors, to 
the conclusion that Spain had violated the fair and equitable treatment standard con-
tained in the Spain-Argentina BIT. No explanation was given on the precise meaning 
of the lack of transparency. See Maffezini (Argentina) v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID 
Case No. ARB/97/7, Award, 13 November 2000. See also UNCTAD, Transparency,

reasoning is supported by the Decision in the SwemBalt case (Swe-
den v. Latvia) 74 and the Metalclad case. 75 
Moreover, even if the investor learns about a violation of national 
laws and the government continues for some time to tolerate this situation, 
the investor must be protected. If the government later suddenly started en-
forcing the law in a discriminatory fashion, the same reasoning as that ad-
vanced above would apply. But even if the government acts in a non-
discriminatory way, it should be liable for compensation if it fails to enforce 
the law non-proportionately, for example without a transitional period for 
the old, by national standards "unlawful", investments. Keeping in mind that 
IIAs, among other functions, intend to promote rules of good governance, 
the requirements for the host State, though depending on the individual cir-
cumstances, should not be too low. 76 One might therefore conclude that a 
State, by consistently disregarding legal formalities at the time it issues li-
cences, loses its right to withdraw such licences for those formal violations 
if it does not conduct the withdrawal with procedural regularity and in a 
non-discriminatory manner. 

74 

Reported by K. Hobér, 'Investment Arbitration in Eastern Europe: Recent Cases on 
Expropriation', 14 American Review of International Arbitration (2003), 407. This 
case was concerned with the removal and subsequent public auctioning of a ship by 
Latvian governmental officials due to an alleged breach of a lease contract on an an-
chorage. The Tribunal based its finding of indirect expropriation on the failure of the 
government to inform the investor about the (alleged) invalidity (retroactive change of 
laws) of the lease contract in due time (four months inactivity) and cacophonic state-
ments of a governmental official, the participation of governmental officers in the (al-
leged) illegal activity of concluding the lease contract and the missing proportionality 
between the (alleged) wrongful act of the investor and State measures; id., 414. 

75 

The NAFTA Tribunal in Metalclad dealt with a case in which the investor did not 
obey the local building and environmental rules and thus acted unlawfully in regard to 
national rules. However, representations were made by governmental officials who 
were not aware of their own legal order. It was held that the investor's legitimate ex-
pectations in the lawfulness of his undertaking cannot be destroyed if he learns about 
the illegality of the investment after it was made. Refer also to J. Paulsson & Z. Doug-
las, 'Indirect Expropriation in Investment Treaty Arbitrations', in N. Horn, (ed.), Arbi-
trating Foreign Investment Disputes (2004), 154-157.

2. Second Scenario: A State Measure Which Is Lawful by Na-
tional Standards But Discriminatory and Accompanied With 
Mala Fide 

In our second scenario, the mining licence is defective as in [scenario 
1. The government does not want to withdraw the mining licence because it 
fears negative consequences for the country's reputation as a location for 
investment. It therefore suddenly, without giving any prior notice, starts 
enforcing a certain tax rule or changes the interpretation of a certain tax rule 
in general, knowing, however, that this change in administrative practice 
hits only a certain investor or even intending to hit a certain investor. As a 
consequence, one foreign company goes bankrupt. 

a) Russian Law 

Russian law does not sanction a State organ changing the interpreta-
tion of tax legislation. The fact that the intention of the taxation was not to 
obtain money but rather to harm (mala fide) would not change this analysis. 
Also, as already mentioned above, outside the Constitution there is no pro-
hibition of discrimination under Russian law. Whilst Russian law, in par-
ticular constitutional law, recognizes the principle of non-discrimination, the 
literature 77 has apparently only dealt with the implications of this principle 
for investors at the beginning of their investment activity, and court practice 
has up to now not taken up these principles. 78 

b) International Investment Agreements 

Changing and adapting national taxation regimes is in general not 
considered to be an illegitimate regulation but something necessary to main-
tain and further the overall development and prosperity of a society. 79 As 
already mentioned, in principle a foreign investor cannot have any legiti-

mate expectation that a given tax regime is not subject to any alterations. 
This was confirmed, for example, in the awards in Feldman 80 and Goetz. 81 
In the scenario at hand, however, the situation might be different. If 
the administration suddenly starts enforcing a certain tax rule in general, 
knowing, however, that it hits only a certain investor or even intending this, 
then several conflicting interests need to be balanced. On the one hand, a 
State must have the right to adapt its tax policy to new situations, maybe 
even implementing the recommendations of international expert panels. If 
the tax rules are applied in law and in fact non-discriminatorily, and if this 
change can be seen as proportionate in regard to the ends pursued with the 
change, then it is the ordinary risk of doing business when a certain com-
pany might not be able to pay its taxes due to its financial situation, i.e. in-
sufficient profits, and this could happen even if the host State was aware of 
this effect. 82 On the other hand, a discriminating effect, not in law but in 
fact, but originating from sudden and unexpected changes accompanied by 
mala fide intentions should be remedied by IIAs if the damage suffered by a 
foreign investor is "substantial". 83 The investor can reasonably expect that 
tax laws are not used for protective aims or political purposes totally unre-
lated to taxation but for the functions usually assigned to them. It was also 
sudden, unreasonable and unpredictable changes in the application of law, 
though not a tax law, which led to the finding in favour of the investor in the 
CME case. 84 
From a host State point of view, one could argue in defence of meas-
ures taken that the same result (bankruptcy) would have also been inflicted

upon the investor by a mining licence withdrawal. Such an argument, how-
ever, does not seem very convincing. Even if a licence withdrawal could 
have been conducted in a non-discriminatory, transparent manner with a 
bona fide intention, as referred to in the first scenario, the plea of a "hypo-
thetical alternative lawful conduct" would not rule out the finding of indirect 
expropriation 85 , but might, and this is certainly a very cautious 'might', only 
have an effect on the determination of the damages. 86 Thus, to sum up, the 
conduct of the tax authorities must undoubtedly be attributed to the host 
State. 87 The discriminatory application of tax laws coupled with mala fide in 

85 

A first, rather simple argument relates to the rules of causality. An infringement of a 
given right cannot be imputed to someone if it can be demonstrated that the infringe-
ment would also have been caused if this person had acted correctly. For the example 
here, this would mean that the infringement (indirect expropriation) would also have 
occurred if the host State had lawfully revoked the licence. This apparently is not the 
case. Thus, the host State must have inflicted the infringement. A second argument 
may be drawn from the second Amco v. Indonesia Award on the Merits, Amco Asia 
Corporation and Others v. The Republic of Indonesia, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, 
Resubmitted, Award on the Merits, 31 May 1990 (hereafter referred to as Amco II 
(Merits)), in para. 143, the Tribunal states: "[E]ven were a decision on grounds other 
than those stated in the Degree in principle sustainable, they could no more be lawful 
than the decision made on grounds of shortfall of investment, because of the general 
background that pervaded the decision-making." It does not matter that the same re-
sult could have been reached in another way, i.e. that the foreign investment could 
have also been adversely affected by measures which are in principle sustainable; it is 
only the process of how this result is reached (and that this process was ultimately 
malconducted) which matters. Of the same opinion: Sornarajah, supra note 1, 390. 

86 

It is open to question whether all of the loss inflicted upon the foreign investor by the 
discriminatory application of certain tax laws can be attributed to the host State due to 
the fact that substantial damages would have occurred also in the case of a lawful (in 
terms of public international law) revocation of the licence. The Amco II (Merits) 
Award casts doubts on this; in para. 174, it reads: "To argue, as did Indonesia, that al-
though there had been procedural irregularities, a 'fair BKPM' [the governmental 
body acting on behalf of Indonesia] would still have revoked the licence, because of 
Amco's own shortcomings, is to misaddress causality. The Tribunal cannot pronounce 
upon what a 'fair BKPM' would have done. This is both speculative, and not the issue 
before it. Rather, it is required to characterise the acts that BKPM did engage in and to 
see if those acts, if unlawful, caused damage to Amco. It is not required to see if, had 
it acted fairly, harm might then rather have been attributed to Amco's own fault."

the way described above that has a severe impact on the foreign investment 
constitutes an indirect expropriation. 
As for the standards of proof it will be no easy task for any investor to 
establish the "intention" of a government. 88 However, the "formal state-
ments of the responsible Minister or a series of circumstances pointing to 
the protectionist intent being the main motivator for a policy can be taken to 
indicate the 'intention'." 89 Therefore, since the internal governmental papers 
which reveal the true intention of a government are often -understandably -
not accessible in their entirety to international tribunals, in order to prevent 
cacophonic statements, governments are well advised to keep their high 
ranking officials, to whose statements international tribunals would have to 
turn, under close check until a final position has emerged within the gov-
ernment; 90 they are best off developing a public communications strategy

90 

Difficulties in finding officials with adequate training should not serve a host State as 
a valid defence, since it signed the IIA fully aware of its duties and the quality of its 
officials. 

GoJIL 1 (2009) 2, 291-327 

318 

even in cases where laws have been considered illegal. 91 A fortiori, it is not 
likely to be of importance if the implementation of a law is the means by 
which an illegal decision is to be implemented. The action of a government 
would therefore clearly be legal. The same would apply if no new tax provi-
sion is enacted but an already existing provision is interpreted in a different 
way. 92 In both cases, the outlook for an investor is not promising. 

b) International Investment Agreements 

In this scenario, much depends on the representations the government 
made to the foreign investor in regard to the tax regime. Did the govern-
ment, for example, include a stabilization clause in the licence agreement, 
ensuring that taxes and other financial liabilities would remain as agreed for 
the duration of the concession? Then, the investor can reasonably expect 
than the tax regime will remain unchanged and raise this in the BIT context. 
If the government changes the law despite these representations and, as a 
result, the company finds it difficult to continue operations and closes op-
erations, then the government appears to be liable under international law 
irrespective of the company's decision to close down, as the decision in Re-
vere suggests. 93 Otherwise, the host State's measures are lawful if executed 
without any discrimination.

Revere, supra note 19, 291 "In our view, the effects of the Jamaican Government's 
actions in repudiating its long term commitments to RJA (the subsidiary of RC), have 
substantially the same impact on effective control over use and operation as if the 
properties were themselves conceded by a concession contract that was repudiated 
[…]" For a discussion, refer to R. Dolzer, 'Indirect Expropriation of Alien Property', 
1 ICSID Review (1986), 41-65, Sornarajah, supra note 1, 378-380. In contrast, in the 
Elsi case, the foreign company, in the view of the Court, went bankrupt because of its 
own financial situation and not because of the action of the host State; Elettronica Si-
cula S.p.A. (U.S. v. Italy), Award, ICJ Reports 1989, 15, para 119.. 

Legitimate expectations can only be vested in a legitimate business 
venture. In the given case, the entrepreneur uses illegal means to acquire a 
competitive advantage. If the host State were to enforce its criminal laws to 
prevent the foreign investor from doing so and bring him to justice, this 
would be a legitimate exercise of administrative powers. However, the 
situation at hand poses another question. Is it justifiable that the State inten-
tionally bankrupts an investor using taxation law as means of punishment, 
thus attributing functions to that law which an investor cannot reasonably 
foresee, in order to prosecute and remedy the criminal offences committed 
by the foreign investor? 
If the bankruptcy is the consequence of an unbiased, non-
discriminatory and proportionate prosecution carried out in good faith, es-
pecially if the bankruptcy relates to the payment of taxes owed, penalties 
due and the conviction of the investor in criminal proceedings, a State 
should not be held liable for the bankruptcy. However, a host State should 
by no means be able to plead the tu quoque argument, since it is generally 
bound to the notion of legality, in contrast to a private actor. It should, there-
fore, not be allowed to (ab)use the violation of the law by the foreign inves-
tor as a reason to disregard any due process requirements, one of which is to 
apply the laws in conformity with the functions assigned to them. 94 By using 

94 

Tecmed, supra note 24, para. 154. 

GoJIL 1 (2009) 2, 291-327 

320 

taxation law, which does not have a function of acting as penalization for 
criminal charges (e.g. bribery), those due process requirements are in-
fringed, since no investor can reasonably foresee such an application. More-
over, the host State is also required to conduct the prosecution of allegedly 
criminal behaviour committed by the foreign investor itself using due proc-
ess. The investment only "loses" protection in so far as it is erected on ille-
gal groundings. Any deprivation or diminishment of property rights beyond 
this point cannot be justified. The principle that the taking of property "as 
means of the exaction of a criminal penalty is lawful" 95 and that it does not 
need to be compensated has been overridden by the groundbreaking changes 
brought by IIAs. 96 

II. State Action Which Is Unlawful by National Standards 

1. Fifth Scenario: Unlawful State Action Against the Man-
agement, Management Personally Involved in Crimes 

In our fifth scenario, a foreign investor runs his business venture in a 
legal manner. However, the management is personally involved in crimes. 
The investor is imprisoned, however not for the personal crime that he has 
allegedly committed, but for a completely unrelated tax matter. The ultimate 
intention of the government is to hit the business. As a consequence of the 
management being imprisoned, banks withdraw their loans and, as a conse-
quence of that, the business goes bankrupt. 

a) Russian Law 

As frequently reported in the press, Mr Khodorkovsky was imprisoned 
in 2004 for committing violations of tax legislation and subsequently con-
demned to serve many years for those tax violations. The arguments report-
edly made by people close to Mr Khodorkovsky and by himself included 
that, in reality, the reason for the imprisonment was not the violation of tax 
legislation but the intention of Mr Khodorkovsky to get involved in politics 
and the desire of the Russian State to acquire his wealth, namely the Yukos

Group. However, in the decisions publicly available, 97 this argument has 
never been considered, and there is no evidence that it has been used by 
representatives of Yukos and/or Mr Khodorkovsky as a legal defence. Ig-
noring the intentions of the State in the results of legal proceedings in this 
manner does coincide with what most Russian lawyers would confirm as 
their view, namely that measures taken by the State against an individual 
would not have any impact when considering the legal merits of an action 
against a group of companies in the context of assessing an action that could 
potentially constitute an indirect expropriation. 

b) International Investment Agreements 

Prosecution of crimes is the duty and prerogative of any State and, 
thus, is viewed as legitimate State action. As already stated, if the bank-
ruptcy is the consequence of an "orderly" prosecution, then the State is not 
liable for the bankruptcy. However, it is also generally accepted that an un-
justified "attack" on the management is regarded as an "attack" on the in-
vestment because the foreign investor is entitled to organize and control his 
business venture as a part of the bunch of property rights protected by an 
IIA. 98 Here again, the intention and the nature of the governmental actions 
would be the decisive criteria. If charges are only brought up "artificially" 
with an intention to bankrupt the investor, the State conduct will come 
within the reach of an IIA. This is necessary in order to protect foreign in-
vestment comprehensively as envisaged in the IIAs. Thus, indirectly, IIAs

seem to have also a moderating, good governance effect on the prosecution 
of crimes, at least in regard to a foreign investor. However, a criminal inves-
tigation which raises issues of human rights violations would not be remedi-
able in international investment law; it would be a case for an international 
human rights convention like the ECHR. 99 

2. Sixth Scenario: Illegality "All Around" 

The foreign investor uses its company for financing a political cam-
paign against taxation of oil proceeds in order to create a favourable busi-
ness environment, including gaining significant influence on the State's 
legislature and administration for its company. The campaign, however, is 
partially illegal under the laws of the host country. Also, the investor is in-
volved in murder and in bribing officials responsible for the prosecution of 
the murders in order to secure its favourable business environment. As a 
consequence, the foreign investor gains significant influence on the process 
of forming the host State's will. The State takes action illegal under the 
State's law against the company and the investor with a view to stop these 
activities. These activities comprise the engineering of arbitrary and un-
founded tax claims, the arbitrary and non-proportionate seizure of produc-
tion facilities, the arbitrary freezing of funds, the harassment of the man-
agement, non-transparent investigations and a public auction which from the 
beginning is anything but open to bidders other than the pre-chosen winner. 
All these activities are conducted with the view to drive the company out of 
the business (total loss), at which the State ultimately succeeded. 

a) Russian Law 

As discussed above, intentions are not relevant under Russian law. 
This is particularly true for intentions of State action. 100 There nothing in the 
literature, practice or in discussions with Russian lawyers suggesting that 
any interconnection between actions against a shareholder and a company 
from a legal point of view would be accepted as making a difference under 
Russian law. In addition, whilst under Russian law there are rather detailed 
legal provisions about national emergency, no evidence of a theory of extra-

99 

By means of a (partially illegal) political campaign 102 and criminal ac-
tivities, 103 a foreign investor created a favourable business environment for 
his company. In this process he gained significant influence on all three 
branches of government of the host State and ultimately to a significant ex-
tent controlled the process of forming the political will in the host State. An 
orderly prosecution became impossible due to the political influence of the 
foreign investor. The corrupting activities of the investor started to threaten 
the very democratic order in the country. In order to stop these activities and 
with a view to return to a state of lawfulness, non-corrupted parts of the 
government take steps to dismantle the influence of the foreign investor by 
bankrupting him. In the course of action as prescribed above, the title of 
property is either transferred by auction to another entity or the investment 
is completely devaluated. This scenario drives the point even further to the 
extremes and poses the question of where the boundaries of the protection 
of a foreign investment by an IIA are to be drawn. 
By taking the measures described above, the host State pursues le-
gitimate objectives: securing State order, democracy and pluralism and re-
erecting the rule of law. However, does this give the State the right to take 
recourse to any means at its disposal? We would like to suggest that propor-
tionality has to be retained also in such cases. Even if the intention of the 
government is to return to a state of lawfulness and to secure the continuing 
operation of such a noble concept as democracy, and even though the for-

101 

A search in the most commonly used legal database on "extra-legal emergency" as of 
8 April 2009 gave no results. 

102 

The interference in domestic politics by foreign investors seen as agents of their home 
State is a well-known instance (as with Allende in Chile) and has been addressed by 
prohibition in many soft-law instruments (voluntary codes of conduct). However, no 
hard-law international obligation has arisen so far. In general, there has been little 
movement in formulating binding obligations of foreign investors (multinational cor-
porations). Refer to Sornarajah, supra note 1, 171, 174-182. Moreover, in general, 
home States do not carry responsibility for the acts of their nationals not acting on be-
half of the home State abroad; refer to Article 4-11 of the International Law Com-
mision's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. 

103 

It seems that criminal activities of a foreign investor do not automatically render an 
investment unprotected by IIAs. See Sornarajah, supra note 1, 390.

eign investor could not reasonably expect that his illegal activities would be 
continually tolerated by the host State, a legitimate expectation of due con-
duct of the prosecution of investment-related crimes should nevertheless not 
easily be compromised. Unfortunately, arguments based on the defence of 
such noble but very broad and vague concepts such as democracy and/or the 
rule of law are also capable of being (ab)used to cover protectionist activi-
ties in a host State and to quieten criticism from abroad. 
The situation at hand, however, could come close to a state of neces-
sity 104 within the meaning of Article 25 of the International Law Commis-
sion's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrong-
ful Acts, which is seen to reflect customary international law. 105 The wrong-
fulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation is pre-
cluded when, inter alia, the act is the only way for the State to safeguard an 
essential interest against a grave and immanent peril (Article 25(1)(a)). If 
one is prepared to accept the perpetuation of democracy as essential inter-
est 106 and is, moreover, willing to view a single businessman or a small 
group of such as grave and immanent peril to the core of democratic system, 
recourse to the defence of "state of necessity" is still, however, put in doubt 
by the fact that it is confined to situations to which the respondent State has 
not contributed (Article 25(2)(b)), at least not in a manner "sufficiently sub-
stantial and not merely incidental or peripheral." 107 However, by allowing a 
foreign investor to gain significant influence on essential functions of gov-
ernment and not fighting corruption effectively, the State contributed to 
such a situation. If one were, nevertheless, to accept such a defence of the

host State, this would mean compromising one of the main objectives of 
IIAs, i.e. to promote good governance standards. By concluding an IIA, the 
State committed itself to such standards and should have fought corruption 
right from the beginning. It should not be rewarded for failing to do so. 108 

C. Conclusions and Outlook 

The task of both the national and international rules governing foreign 
investment activities is to balance legitimate business interests and the 
State's sovereign "right to regulate". From a national perspective, our sur-
vey reveals that the legal order of a country, in transition like Russia, is 
hardly prepared to strike an adequate balance between the aforementioned 
interests. Much more than occasional differences in views of courts, 109 it 
fails in a systematic manner to dispense any protection against the "com-
mon" threats a foreign investor is exposed to in such a business environ-
ment. It appears ignorant of notions such as due process, the prohibition of 
discrimination and transparency. Turning to the international perspective, a 
comparison of the outcomes produced by the national and international legal 
orders demonstrates that the former can hardly live up to the standards re-

As demonstrated, for instance, in the Media Most Gusinsky case, in which the partly 
government-owned Gazprom giant guaranteed two loans to Media Most in 1998 that 
totalled US$ 380 million, secured by a 40 per cent piece of the company. After criti-
cizing the politics of the Kremlin, with the Kremlin allegedly being instrumental in 
bankrupting Media Most by calling in the loans, the owner of Media Most, Mr Gusin-
sky, was arrested, allegedly without any charges, and he was allegedly compelled to 
sign an agreement to sell his company. Available at www.mytimes.com/2000/11/15/

April 2009). In response to this, the ECHR ruled that the Russian government had vio-
lated Articles 5 and 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to 
Gusinsky, namely his rights to freedom and security. The Court ruled that the viola-
tion in itself was enough for moral damages to be awarded. As a result, it asked the 
Russian Federation to pay € 88.000 in damages. Available at http://cmiskp.echr.coe.

seem to have been made before Russian courts.

quired and imposed by international investment instruments, even in "eve-
ryday situations", as the discussion of our scenarios has revealed. 
Two possible conclusions can be drawn from this observation. Either 
the development of international investment law has gone too far, quasi 
overstraining the capabilities (or the willingness) of the legal order to im-
bibe the international standards, or Russia, as just an example of many other 
economies in transition, has to start urgently-more than ten years after 
signing its first BIT-living up to the standards of good governance re-
quired by the IIAs it has signed if it does not want to face significant exter-
nalization of legal disputes concerned with foreign investment. 110 This is no 
fanciful perspective. 
As regards the first possible conclusion, we do not think that the de-
velopment of international investment law has gone too far. Most IIAs, on 
the one hand, offer a foreign investor the necessary back-up against sudden 
protective measures of its host State which is needed to conduct business in 
a foreign jurisdiction with a certain degree of predictability. On the other 
hand, IIAs are also capable of accommodating legitimate State interests. 
Moreover, they encourage and promote "good governance" standards. In-
ternational commitments are at present the best way to protect foreign in-
vestments against internal attacks and differing interests in the political es-
tablishment of a State. However, the host State itself will also benefit from 
an internal legal order which acts transparently and produces reliable, pre-
dictable and just outcomes. Thus, with regard to foreign direct investments, 
the national legal systems of economies in transition should make an effort 
to live up to the standards set under international investment law. By doing 
so, these states can create incentives for foreign investors to perceive their 
domestic legal systems as a genuine alternative to international investment 
law and arbitration. This bears of course the caveat that in view of the 
amounts usually involved in such a dispute, the potential for protective 
measures can be minimised, but never be wholly excluded. Of course, 
sometimes a country subject to international investment arbitration for the 
first time has to learn the hard way about the obligations it has signed up 

110 

One way to force an international investor to resort to national jurisdictions is the 
"local remedies requirement". However, the exhaustion of local remedies as a precon-
dition for commencing an international investment arbitration is nowadays rarely re-
quired by BITs; C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), 391-393. 
For an appraisal of alleged new tendencies in arbitration, see C. Schreuer, 'Calvo's 
Grandchildren: The Return of Local Remedies in Investment Arbitration', 4 The Law 
and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals (2005) 1, 1-3.

for. But at the end of the day, drawing the right conclusions from the lessons 
learned, it should begin to improve its administrative procedures in particu-
lar and its legal system in general so that foreign investors do not feel the 
need to resort to international arbitration in the first place. 
This brings us to our second possible conclusion which, in our view, 
appears to be the correct analysis. Countries such as Russia should be aware 
of the costs which they have to bear if they are not capable or willing to of-
fer the necessary legal tools to respond to the needs and problems of foreign 
investors. They risk that legal issues are litigated far away from the place 
where the conflict originated, adjudicated by rules they were able to shape 
only to a limited extent, and decided by people sometimes not fully aware of 
the local situation. In a nutshell, they risk marginalizing their own legal or-
der, which, in general, should be able to best accommodate the country's 
specificities. 
Whilst countries may ignore individual cases for some time, in the 
long run there are only two ways out: either to take leave from the IIA re-
gime, which would completely sideline the country in question, in the view 
of the investors' as well as the state community,; or while globalization is 
deepening to stop hesitating and tackle the issue.

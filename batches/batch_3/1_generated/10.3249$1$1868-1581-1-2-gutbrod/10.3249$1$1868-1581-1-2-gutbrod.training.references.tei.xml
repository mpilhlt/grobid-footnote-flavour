Conclusions and Outlook .....................................................................</orgName>. <title level="a">Protection against Indirect Expropriation 293 Introduction In recent years, direct expropriation 2 has rarely been seen. 3 States which wish to import capital do not like to be associated with posing a per-manent, non-calculable threat to foreign-owned property but prefer to pre-sent themselves as jurisdictions with very stable, reliable and orderly regula-tory environments. 4 Expropriation, however, has by no means vanished; its execution has just become more subtle. 5 Ambiguously or generously 2 In a nutshell, direct expropriation is the compulsory transfer of legal title or the out-right seizure of property by the State. In contrast, indirect expropriation refers to the situation in which the investor formally remains legal owner</title>. See, instead of all, M.

	<bibl><title level="a">296 This article will look at six typically posed challenges to foreign in-vestment posed by administrative acts, focusing on the issues of discrimina-tion, mala fide and lack of transparency, and will discuss the response of national and international rules applicable to the situation of indirect expro-priation. 10 These scenarios are based on Russian legal regulations 11 and are inspired by the events in the Commonwealth of Independent States reality but by no means intend to be a reflection of facts. We will show that the internal legal order cannot respond to any of these challenges through striking a just balance between legitimate business interests of the foreign investor and the State's sovereign right to regulate. Rather, it is the international (contractual) law on foreign investment which offers the clearly more sophisticated framework for a balanced settlement of a foreign investment dispute. Our prediction is that if economies in transi-tion, like Russia, do not start living up to the standards required by interna-tional investment agreements quickly, they might face the risk of the mar-ginalization of their national legal orders in the settlement of foreign in-vestment disputes. Such conflicts, which earlier clearly had an "internal component", would increasingly become international only and would, in this sense, be externalized.

It has been suggested that the phrase 'tantamount to expropriation' does not only refer to intentional or obvious indirect expropriation but that "[i]t also captures the multiplicity of inappropriate regulatory acts, omis-sions, and other deleterious conduct that undermines the vital normative framework created and maintained by BITs</title>". <title level="a">12 Recalling the objectives pur-sued by entering into BITs and similar agreements -the establishment and maintenance of a "healthy investment climate" 13 -the concept of 'indirect 12 13 Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969</title>, available at <ptr type="web">www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/treaties.htm</ptr> (last visited <biblScope unit="volume">11</biblScope> <date>August 2005</date>), <title level="a">asks to have due regard to the object and purpose in the construction of a treaty. Most, if not all, BITs, as well as multinational agreements on investment protection such as the European Energy Treaty or the NAFTA, intend, as provided for in their preambles, to establish favourable conditions for investment by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State. For a review of typical preambles, see Dolzer &amp;Stevens, supra note 8, 20-21. In short, they envisage a "healthy investment climate" which is conditio sine qua non for the attraction of foreign direct investment.

It must be stressed again that BITs and MITs are not intended to prohibit legitimate regulatory measures by the host State. On the con-trary, they encourage the host State to exercise its regulatory powers in a transparent, non-discriminating, non-abusive way guided by reason and the rule of law, at least towards the foreign investor.

The discussion surrounding three important factors which have emerged from this process deserve to be men-tioned here. The severity of the impact on the owner's legal status, namely the ability to use, enjoy, control and freely dispose of his investment, has been accepted as a central factor in drawing the dividing line between expropria-tion and legitimate administrative regulation. 23 Importantly, however, it is controversial whether this severity is the sole/predominant factor 24 or merely one of several important factors. 25 There is case law supporting both supra note 3, 121.

Under Russian law, raw materials and subsoil resources are the prop-erty of the State. 42 However, Russian law provides for the right of a third party to acquire such assets. 43 A mining licence is the legal instrument which is used to acquire title to a good that is being extracted from under-ground. Due to its importance and special nature, a mining licence is typi-cally acquired through a tender. One of the major criteria for decision under the tender regime is the minimal amount to be extracted</title> ("<title level="a">Minimal Amount") for the purpose of ensuring the efficient use of subsoil re-sources. 44 However, in many cases, the Minimal Amounts are not matched in practice. Also, formal violations of law reportedly take place frequently; ing the latter from shifting the costs of regulation to the former; see, Wälde &amp; Kolo, supra note 19, 845.

The argument that other investors in similar situations would not have their licences withdrawn would also not be heard in any of the proceedings. Whilst there is a general prohibition of discrimination under the Russian Constitution, this has not been implemented in procedural law up to now. Turning to the possibility of proceedings before the Constitutional Court, due to the very complicated procedures, rules, and reasons for initia-tion of proceedings by the Russian Constitutional Court, it is unlikely to hear the case, although sometimes decisions of the Russian Constitutional Court are unexpected and do not clearly follow established rules. Furthermore, a licence is not deemed to be a property right. 52 The fact that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company when it has a licence would suggest that, if the licence is looked at from an economic per-spective</title>, <note>it has a value and therefore is a property right or at least is to be treated as a property right.

This scenario clearly raises the issue of discrimination, which we will focus on here. As aforementioned, the non-discrimination requirement in the event of indirect expropriation "demands that governmental measures, procedures and practices be non-discriminatory even in the treatment of members of the same group of aliens</title>." <title level="a">60 It is apparent that this is not the case here. In spite of this, one may argue in favour of the State that the government is "merely" enforcing the law, in other words serving the rule of law when revoking a defective licence whose issuance terms were not followed by the investor. Regarding the "non-compliance with the terms of the licence," under international law the investor certainly has no legal right to have his licence be held valid if he does not act in conformity with its terms. He was aware of the terms at the moment of receipt and could not have had any legitimate expectations that an illegal situation would be tolerated. A single investor or a group of investors within a larger grouping of investors in a similar situa-tion may have conducted their business not in compliance with the licence conditions and, therefore, also not in compliance with the law; but even if this is tolerated by the administration for some time, the investors cannot rely on continued toleration of the illegal situation. The same applies to an investor whose illegal conduct of business was not tolerated right from the beginning. He cannot claim to be discriminated against simply because he was being treated in compliance with the law. Any other finding would be clearly against the rule of law and the principle of legality (Legalitätsprin-zip). Likewise, if the administration changes its internal practice in general in regard to the application of administrative discretion after it learns about the illegality and begins to apply the law properly, then of course there is no 59 Licences are now clearly protected by IIAs; see for example</title> <orgName>Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited and P.T.

	<bibl><note>310 expectation which deserves to be protected. A government must have the right to return to a state of legality. 61 This principle was correctly applied in the Estonian Bank Licence case</note> (<pubPlace>Genin (U.S</pubPlace>.A.) v. <title level="a">Estonia) 62 The Central Bank of Estonia cancelled the bank licence of the claimant in conformity with the Estonian Banking Code 63 due to the Claimant's severe violations. The Tribunal rejected the claim for compensation due to the fact that the Central Bank of Estonia had carried out its supervision duty in full compliance with the law, non-arbitrarily, and without discrimination; and in doing so, the Tribunal bal-anced the procedural conduct of the government and the (illegal) conduct of the investor. However, one must ask whether the same reasoning can be applied if the government fails generally to enforce a certain law -which it was obliged to do without any discretion and was able to enforce -when it just picks one out of a group of investors in a similar (illegal) situation and sud-denly enforces the given law only against this one particular investor, while claiming to serve the rule of law? We do not think so. 64 If a statute fails to create its intended "equal treatment" generally by systematic illegal execu-tion 65 of the law, then the proper application in one or a few instances would constitute a violation of the non-discrimination requirement. Equality under the law means first and foremost equal application of it</title>. <note>66 Even if the inves-tor is not entitled to demand treatment which is against the law, he has the right to demand that the State not apply the law in his case differently from 61 Of the same opinion but not differentiating: AlQurashi, supra note 22</note>, <biblScope unit="page">914</biblScope>.</bibl>

If a host State lacks the capabilities to handle all cases at once, it must demonstrate that the enforcement of a given law against the investor is the first instance in a uniform conceptual approach towards the state of legality. 69 With regard to our scenario, this would mean that the State should be barred from pleading that it serves the principle of legality as long as it fails to demonstrate that it is truly returning to a state of legality. 70 Thus, the treatment of the investor must be characterized as arbitrary, discriminatory and exposing him to sectional prejudice.

Even if a licence withdrawal could have been conducted in a non-discriminatory, <note>transparent manner with a bona fide intention, as referred to in the first scenario, the plea of a "hypo-thetical alternative lawful conduct" would not rule out the</note> <title level="a">finding of indirect expropriation 85 , but might, and this is certainly a very cautious 'might', only have an effect on the determination of the damages. 86 Thus, to sum up, the conduct of the tax authorities must undoubtedly be attributed to the host State. 87 The discriminatory application of tax laws coupled with mala fide in 85 A first, rather simple argument relates to the rules of causality. An infringement of a given right cannot be imputed to someone if it can be demonstrated that the infringe-ment would also have been caused if this person had acted correctly. For the example here, this would mean that the infringement (indirect expropriation) would also have occurred if the host State had lawfully revoked the licence. This apparently is not the case. Thus, the host State must have inflicted the infringement. A second argument may be drawn from the second Amco v. Indonesia Award on the Merits, Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. The Republic of Indonesia, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Resubmitted, Award on the Merits, 31 May 1990 (hereafter referred to as Amco II (Merits)), in para. 143, the Tribunal states: "[E]ven were a decision on grounds other than those stated in the Degree in principle sustainable, they could no more be lawful than the decision made on grounds of shortfall of investment, because of the general background that pervaded the decision-making</title>." <title level="a">It does not matter that the same re-sult could have been reached in another way, i.e. that the foreign investment could have also been adversely affected by measures which are in principle sustainable; it is only the process of how this result is reached (and that this process was ultimately malconducted) which matters.

Rather, it is required to characterise the acts that BKPM did engage in and to see if those acts, if unlawful, caused damage to Amco.

The campaign, however, is partially illegal under the laws of the host country. Also, the investor is in-volved in murder and in bribing officials responsible for the prosecution of the murders in order to secure its favourable business environment. As a consequence, the foreign investor gains significant influence on the process of forming the host State's will. The State takes action illegal under the State's law against the company and the investor with a view to stop these activities. These activities comprise the engineering of arbitrary and un-founded tax claims, the arbitrary and non-proportionate seizure of produc-tion facilities, the arbitrary freezing of funds, the harassment of the man-agement, non-transparent investigations and a public auction which from the beginning is anything but open to bidders other than the pre-chosen winner</title>. <note>All these activities are conducted with the view to drive the company out of the business (total loss), at which the State ultimately succeeded</note>.</bibl>

The corrupting activities of the investor started to threaten the very democratic order in the country.

	<bibl><author>C.</author> <title level="a">Conclusions and Outlook The task of both the national and international rules governing foreign investment activities is to balance legitimate business interests and the State's sovereign "right to regulate</title>". <title level="a">From a national perspective, our sur-vey reveals that the legal order of a country, in transition like Russia, is hardly prepared to strike an adequate balance between the aforementioned interests. Much more than occasional differences in views of courts, 109 it fails in a systematic manner to dispense any protection against the "com-mon" threats a foreign investor is exposed to in such a business environ-ment. It appears ignorant of notions such as due process, the prohibition of discrimination and transparency. Turning to the international perspective, a comparison of the outcomes produced by the national and international legal orders demonstrates that the former can hardly live up to the standards re-108 For case law on the legality of the investment in general see</title>, <title level="j">Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

	<bibl><title level="m">326 quired and imposed by international investment instruments, even in "eve-ryday situations</title>", <note>as the discussion of our scenarios has revealed. Two possible conclusions can be drawn from this observation. Either the development of international investment law has gone too far, quasi overstraining the capabilities (or the willingness) of the legal order to im-bibe the international standards</note>, <title level="a">or Russia, as just an example of many other economies in transition, has to start urgently-more than ten years after signing its first BIT-living up to the standards of good governance re-quired by the IIAs it has signed if it does not want to face significant exter-nalization of legal disputes concerned with foreign investment</title>. <title level="a">110 This is no fanciful perspective. As regards the first possible conclusion, we do not think that the de-velopment of international investment law has gone too far. Most IIAs, on the one hand, offer a foreign investor the necessary back-up against sudden protective measures of its host State which is needed to conduct business in a foreign jurisdiction with a certain degree of predictability</title>. <title level="a">On the other hand, IIAs are also capable of accommodating legitimate State interests. Moreover, they encourage and promote "good governance" standards. In-ternational commitments are at present the best way to protect foreign in-vestments against internal attacks and differing interests in the political es-tablishment of a State. However, the host State itself will also benefit from an internal legal order which acts transparently and produces reliable, pre-dictable and just outcomes. Thus, with regard to foreign direct investments, the national legal systems of economies in transition should make an effort to live up to the standards set under international investment law. By doing so, these states can create incentives for foreign investors to perceive their domestic legal systems as a genuine alternative to international investment law and arbitration. This bears of course the caveat that in view of the amounts usually involved in such a dispute, the potential for protective measures can be minimised, but never be wholly excluded. Of course, sometimes a country subject to international investment arbitration for the first time has to learn the hard way about the obligations it has signed up 110 One way to force an international investor to resort to national jurisdictions is the "local remedies requirement". However, the exhaustion of local remedies as a precon-dition for commencing an international investment arbitration is nowadays rarely re-quired by BITs; C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A</title> <title level="j">Commentary</title> (<date>2001</date>), <biblScope unit="page">391-393</biblScope>. <title level="a">For an appraisal of alleged new tendencies in arbitration, see C. Schreuer, 'Calvo's Grandchildren: The Return of Local Remedies in Investment Arbitration</title>', 4 <title level="j">The Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals</title> (<date>2005</date>) <biblScope unit="volume">1</biblScope>, <biblScope unit="page">1-3</biblScope>. <title level="a">Protection against Indirect Expropriation 327 for. But at the end of the day, drawing the right conclusions from the lessons learned, it should begin to improve its administrative procedures in particu-lar and its legal system in general so that foreign investors do not feel the need to resort to international arbitration in the first place. This brings us to our second possible conclusion which, in our view, appears to be the correct analysis. Countries such as Russia should be aware of the costs which they have to bear if they are not capable or willing to of-fer the necessary legal tools to respond to the needs and problems of foreign investors. They risk that legal issues are litigated far away from the place where the conflict originated, adjudicated by rules they were able to shape only to a limited extent, and decided by people sometimes not fully aware of the local situation. In a nutshell, they risk marginalizing their own legal or-der</title>, <note>which, in general, should be able to best accommodate the country's specificities. Whilst countries may ignore individual cases for some time, in the long run there are only two ways out: either to take leave from the IIA re-gime</note>, <note>which would completely sideline the country in question, in the view of the investors' as well as the state community,; or while globalization is deepening to stop hesitating and tackle the issue</note>.</bibl>

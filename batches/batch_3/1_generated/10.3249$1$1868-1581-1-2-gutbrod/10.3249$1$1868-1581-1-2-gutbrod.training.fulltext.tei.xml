			<p>the continuing validity of the licence. <ref type="biblio">72</ref> In the words of one commentator,<lb/> governments &quot;should not be able to rely on legal and formal technicalities if<lb/> they consistently (in particular with respect to nationals) disregard such<lb/> technicalities or if such technicalities were not discernible to the investor<lb/> and its domestic legal advisers for reasons of lack of transparency.&quot; <ref type="biblio">73</ref> This<lb/> handled by experts.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Third Scenario: Investor Contributing to Bankruptcy<lb/></head>

			<p>An investor holds a legally valid mining licence. The government<lb/> starts enforcing a certain tax rule or changes the interpretation of a certain<lb/> tax rule in general, with the stated aim to test the ability of companies to pay<lb/> taxes. As the investor is afraid that his company will not survive, he with-<lb/>draws money from the company. As a consequence, the company goes<lb/> bankrupt.<lb/></p>

			<head>a) Russian Law<lb/></head>

			<p>When considering a law, a Russian court would typically look at the<lb/> letter of the law and not at the intention of the lawmaker. As a consequence,<lb/> if the pure letter of the law does not violate the Constitution, the intention of<lb/> the lawmaker would not play any role and, to the best of our knowledge, the<lb/> intention of the lawmaker has not played any role in decisions of courts,<lb/> ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last visited 22.April.2009)<lb/> For academic writing, see, instead of others, Brownlie, supra note 15, 420-456 with<lb/> further references.<lb/></p>

			<p>An investor holds a legally valid mining licence. He has used money<lb/> in an unlawful manner, including by bribing officials, to ensure that taxation<lb/> of revenues derived from the mining licence is not fully enforced against his<lb/> business. Nevertheless, certain taxation rules are suddenly generally en-<lb/>forced, leading to the bankruptcy of the investor, which had been the ulti-<lb/>mate intention of the State.<lb/></p>

			<head>a) Russian Law<lb/></head>

			<p>As discussed above, under Russian law the intention of any State ac-<lb/>tion is not relevant. Accordingly, it cannot possibly be relevant to balance<lb/> various interests against each other.<lb/></p>

			<head>b) International Investment Agreements<lb/></head>

			<figure>Biloune, supra note 23, para.1.<lb/> 100<lb/> As above, see as an example the Decision of the Russian Constitutional Court,<lb/> 18 January 2005, No. 36-O.<lb/> Protection against Indirect Expropriation<lb/> 323<lb/> legal emergency, for instance during a constitutional breakdown, could be<lb/> found. 101<lb/> b) International Investment Agreements</figure>

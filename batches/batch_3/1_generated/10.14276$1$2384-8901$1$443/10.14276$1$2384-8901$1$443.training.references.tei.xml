	<bibl><author>talk in Italy</author>. <title level="a">Even at occasions which do not deal with the future of Europe, the crisis is somehow present. And this presence is an uncomfortable one. And vice versa, how do Italians feel when they address a German audience? Their task is different, but by no means easy. I refrain from reporting my experiences and instead try to say what I feel we would need, namely, a type of communication and interaction in which we are aware of our differences, try to understand the background of the other, and learn to synthesise respect and critique</title>. <note>Do we have examples? Jürgen Habermas in his numerous interventions</note>, maybe? <biblScope unit="page">1</biblScope></bibl>
	<bibl><publisher>Ulrich Beck with his reference to Thomas Mann&apos;s plea for a &quot;European Germany</publisher>&quot;, instead of a &quot;<title level="a">German Europe&quot;? 2 Not only our master thinkers but also many academics and publicists, to some degree even my own writings 3 , could be cited here</title>. <title level="a">This is a way to make friends abroad, but it is not what I have in mind. Much closer to what I believe could be helpful are works such as Angelo Bolaffi&apos;s Cuore Tedesco 4 . Bolaffi has a profound intellectual background, is intimately informed about Germany&apos;s cultural heritage, its history, its institutions, the functioning of German politics, and its intellectual life. However, he seems to be deeply conservative, and his plea for German leadership is &quot;a non-starter&quot; 5 , but he is nonetheless incredibly generous in the way he treats my country</title>. <note>And nevertheless, this is a very enlightening and helpful contribution both to German-Italian relations and to the miserable state of the European Union</note>.</bibl>

	<bibl><author>Reading Bolaffi</author>, <note>you will experience that our countries and &quot;we&quot;, their citizens, are different. Thinking about these differences, you may prioritise this or that on this or that side</note>. <title level="m">But you will also have to consider whether anything can or should be done about it. At this point, it is about time to go in medias res</title>: &quot;<title level="m">Die Wirtschaft ist das Schicksal</title>&quot; <title level="a">(the economy is our destiny) -Walther Rathenau&apos;s frightening insight from the early years of the Weimar Republic has gained a critical topicality as, by now, we all know so well. His economic philosophy was that of a variety of an &quot;organised liberalism&quot; and the motto that I have cited concerned the state of Germany&apos;s first republic -albeit in its European context 6 . What I will complain about in this essay is the disregard of history and conceptual history in European law scholarship both in general and in my own discipline, namely, European economic law</title>, in particular. <title level="a">This is not the kind of discourse which dominates the perception of the economy in European law scholarship. To be sure, this scholarship is meticulously documenting, analysing and discussing each and every element of the European legal materials pertaining to the economy. It is, nonetheless, characterised by a benign neglect of the constitutional importance of the economy and not well prepared to comprehend its political dimensions and context. The implications of this forgetfulness are dramatic, as I will briefly try to explain with the help of three non-legal disciplines: economic sociology, political economy, and economic history</title>. <title level="a">On the first: Karl Polanyi, in his legendary Great Transformation 7 , has argued that the market and the economy are always &quot;socially embedded</title>&quot;. <note>It follows that we have to take the institutional</note>, <title level="a">historical and context into account when observing our economies and trying to make them &quot;more competitive</title>&quot;. <note>It also follows that we have to be aware of the &quot;varieties of capitalism&quot; 8 . Torben Iversen and David Soskice, in a paper entitled &quot;A Structural-Institutional Explanation of the Eurozone Crisis&quot;, have relied on the theory and methodology of this approach in a comparison of the German and the Italian economy 9</note> . <title level="a">They refrain from any moralising in their diagnosis of the current Italian difficulties and their origins on the one hand, and Germany&apos;s present performance and its origins, on the other. Werner Abelshauser, Germany&apos;s leading economic historian, is less cautious and contained. In a recent manifesto</title>, entitled &quot;<title level="m">Europa in Vielfalt einigen</title>&quot; (<note>European unitas in pluralitate</note>) <biblScope unit="volume">10</biblScope> , <note>he argues that Europe risks the destruction of its competitive advantages through the streamlining of its economies. This is precisely the message, to cite another great Italian, in Giandomenico Majone&apos;s recent monograph 11 . It is also the creed underlying this essay 12 . I cannot explain</note>, <note>let</note></bibl>

GREPPI</editor> (eds), <title level="m">The Changing Role of Law in the Age of Supra-and Transnational Christian Joerges, Flaws, Old and New</title>, of <title level="a">Economic Governance in Europe 11 alone defend, all the premises which underlie what I shall be submitting in these few pages, and it is equally impossible to summarise the works which lead to this submission in the subtlety which such a complex and delicate topic deserves in such difficult times. What I will, instead, present are some daring broadsheets which do not elaborate on the analyses in economic sociology, political theory and economic history</title>. <title level="a">They focus on law. Section II is an assault on the orthodoxy of European legal studies. It submits that European economic integration has not only affected the reach of democratic politics and the welfare state legacy of post-war Europe negatively, but, by the same token, gradually disembedded the formerly national economies. Section III will deal with the establishment of the EMU. It will argue that the EMU was neither a re-embedding exercise nor a victory of economic constitutionalism. The EMU will, instead, be characterised as a &quot;diagonal conflict&quot;, creating an irresolvable dilemma. Section IV will turn to Europe&apos;s crisis management and its new modes of economic governance. It is here that the drama transforms into tragedy. The price for the defence of the EMU high: economic prospects remain vague and social recovery is out of sight. The Epilogue (Section V) is on a theoretically viable, but politically unlikely, alternative. What, other than law, was conceivable as the distinctive medium that kept the Community, which the Treaty of Rome had established, together? The story of the early jurisprudence of the ECJ, which transformed the rule of the Treaty into a Constitutional Charter, is well known, and not just to lawyers. So is the characterisation of the Community by Walter Hallstein, the first President of the Commission with an explicit commitment to ordo-liberalism right after the war 13 , as &quot;Schöpfung des Rechts, Rechtsquelle, und Rechtsordnung&quot; 14 . European integration was deliberately launched as an economic project. By necessity, provisions concerning the organisation of the economy were to become extraordinarily important. Here lies the origin of the powerful alliance between the agenda of integration through law and ordo-liberalism</title>. <title level="m">The two allies, however, were hardly aware of the fact that they were operating in tandem.

	<bibl><note>outside Germany knew what ordo-liberalism and its commitment to Ordnungspolitik 15 were about. And the same is true vice versa. Germany&apos;s European law community did not pay much attention to discussions in other countries and foreign??/other languages</note>. &quot;<title level="a">Integration through law</title>&quot;, <note>which was to become a trademark of the European project</note>, <title level="m">was to achieve an umbrella status</title>. <title level="a">Law was famously conceptualised as the &quot;agent and the object of integration&quot; 16 . The assignment of both instrumental functions and inherently legitimating values was by no means pursuing, indeed, it was not even aware of, a notion such as &quot;economic constitutionalism</title>&quot;. <title level="a">And yet, what happened through the so-called constitutionalisation of European law through the doctrines of &quot;direct effect&quot;, &quot;supremacy&quot;, and &quot;pre-emption&quot;, was fully in line with ordo-liberal premises and aspirations. In particular the conceptualisation of the economic freedoms as basic rights which Europe&apos;s market citizens could invoke against their nation states was very much to the liking of the one and only school of thought which took the legal dimensions of the economy really seriously. It seemed now plausible to assign a constitutional status to the core institutions of the Europeanising market economy. One aspect and a crucially problematical implication of the ordo-liberal conceptualisation of legitimate governance through an economic constitution was to constitute a steadily deepening dilemma, namely, the unresolved tensions between the juridification of &quot;the economic&quot; according to the &quot;logic of the market&quot;, on the one hand, and the primacy of democratic legitimacy, on the other. We are currently witnessing a dramatic intensification of this tension. This brief re-construction of the foundational period reveals that this tension is not new and not a late by-product of the financial crisis. It is, instead, a so-to-speak foundational flaw of the integration project. As already underlined, the de facto alliance between economic constitutionalism and integration through law was hardly noticed in European law scholarship, not even in Germany. Economic constitutionalism was a theory residing in the private law compartments of our discipline, whereas European law was understood as public law. This lack of sensitivity is difficult to explain because the young Federal Republic had witnessed an intense debate on the notion of an &quot;economic constitution&quot; in its Basic Law. This debate concerned the conceptualisation of the ordering of the economy as a self-legitimating ordo which required a legal institutionalisation beyond the reach of politics. In this debate, the ordo-liberal school and its allies in the German Staatsrecht were confronted with the quest for democratic legitimacy and the primacy of the legislative authority in the ordering of &quot;economy and society</title>&quot;. <title level="a">The primacy of democratic politics was defended at the time by a clear majority of Germany&apos;s constitutional lawyers even in instances where its policies appeared opportunistic and unprincipled 17 . It is worth recalling that ordo-liberalism experienced a first defeat when 15 An anecdote may explain my hesitation to search for a translation: &quot;Ordnungspolitik&quot; was the German name of Working Group VI in the European Convention in 2003. The English name was &quot;Economic Governance</title>&quot;. <note>Was this an innovative translation? Not really. It was the Convention Secretariat that was responsible for the introduction of the term, in which someone remembered the fierce controversies between &quot;Ordnungspolitik&quot; and &quot;industrial policy&quot; in the Maastricht Intergovernmental Conference in 1991 -a case of &quot;linguistic-discursive path-dependency&quot;, according to Andreas Maurer, which confirms that the German notion is resistant to translation</note>.</bibl>

	<bibl>.2. <title level="m">Foundational Flaws The tension between democratic legitimacy as it was</title> <note>institutionalised in the Member States of the EC, on the one hand, and the</note> <title level="a">establishment of an economic order of supranational validity, on the other, is the most problematical legacy of the foundational period of the integration project</title>. <title level="a">But we have to note some more flaws. One is methodological. The famous formula characterising law as the &quot;object and the agent of integration&quot; was coined at the height of the American law and society movement which promoted the sociological study of law and all sorts of interdisciplinary &quot;law and…&quot; explorations. This revival of legal realism has attracted much attention, not least in the &quot;law-in-context&quot; approach which is very much en vogue at the law department of the European University Institute</title>. &quot;<title level="a">Integration through law&quot;, however, was an agenda which disregarded the embeddedness of law in all sorts of social norms. The attractiveness of &quot;integration through law&quot; in European studies is, nevertheless, unsurprising. Its methodological solipsism, doctrinal rigidity and its formalism enabled transnational interactions and acting, and fostered the emergence of a European community of lawyers and legal scholarship long before social scientists started to take Europe seriously. The primacy of law and its methodological poverty came at a high price, however</title>. &quot;<title level="a">Progress&quot; in European integration was equated with the accomplishment of more legal uniformity, while legal diversity served to provide conclusive reasons for more legal harmonisation. The deficiencies of the integration-through-law fantasy and ideology are precisely the two main flaws of which Giandomenico Majone and Fritz Scharpf keep reminding us: (1) Integration through law rests upon a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; assumption and proceeds accordingly; and (2) In integration-through-law</title>, <note>programmatic integration as more uniformity figures as a goal itself, as Europe&apos;s finalité</note>, <note>which needs no further justification 21 . constitutional &quot;Sozialstaatsgebot&quot; usually recalls the seminal Abendroth/Forsthoff debate, re-constructed, e.g., in C.

	<bibl>. <title level="a">Economic Constitutionalism: its Pyrrhic Victory and Failure in the EMU The Treaty of Maastricht, signed in 1992, is an extremely important turning-point in the development of the integration project. It was perceived at the time as both a continuation and a deepening of what had been accomplished to date at that time, a move towards &quot;an ever closer union&quot;, marked by an opening of new policy-fields and the crowning of the completion of the internal market by monetary union 22</title> .

	<bibl>. <note>The Judicial Fiction of a &quot;Stability Community&quot; The judgment of the German Constitutional Court on the Treaty of Maastricht</note>, <note>which was handed down on 12 October 1993, opened the way to the ratification of the Treaty in Germany</note>. <title level="a">And it proved to be more controversial than the Treaty itself</title>. <title level="a">Tellingly enough, and confirming my introductory remarks on the benign and unfortunate neglect of the economy in European constitutional scholarship, critics found that the Court has mis-stated the views of Hermann Heller, were irritated by the characterisation of the Union as a &quot;Verbund&quot;, rather than a &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;, and even found a touch of Schmittianism in the judicial reasoning 23 . What the Court had to say about the economy seemed less interesting but was, indeed, exciting. The pertinent passages on the European Monetary Union, and the economic constitution with its substantive and institutional substitution of politics and policies by legal rules, was, so the Court held, nothing less than a sine qua non for German participation within the Monetary Union. This assertion was the Court&apos;s response to the argument that the European Union was about to acquire such wide-ranging competences that nation states could no longer act as the masters of their &quot;democratic statehood</title>&quot;. <title level="a">Economic integration, so the Court replied, was an autonomous and apolitical process, which might, and indeed must, take place beyond the reach of Member State political influence. By virtue of a constitutional commitment to price stability and rules that guarded against inappropriate budgetary deficits, the EMU was, in the Court&apos;s view, well structured. Accordingly, all doubts about the democratic legitimacy of economic integration were diverted. To rephrase the argument slightly: yes, the Treaty is compatible with the Basic Law. But this is true only because it is inspired by Germany&apos;s stability philosophy and only as long as this stability pact is actually respected. The Court had been warned</title>, <note>for example, by the President of the Bundesbank, &quot;that a currency union, especially between States which are oriented towards an active economic and social policy, can ultimately only be realized in common with a political union (embracing all essential economic functions) and cannot be realized</note></bibl>

My queries as a German lawyer are twofold</note>. <title level="a">The first: in the two important judgments -Investitionshilfe 28 and Mitbestimmung 29 -the Court had rejected the idea of economic constitutionalism. What is the rational of this turn? The query is, rather, an objection: the German Court is not entitled to write the constitution for the entire Union. To be sure, it based its reasoning upon German principles which affected the rest of Europe only indirectly, but it is precisely this kind of external effect of national decision-making which has to be avoided in a Union of equals 30</title> . <note>My objection as a German citizen is that the Court is, in the end, not in a position to accomplish what it solemnly proclaims. The &quot;stability community&quot; of the EMU existed only on paper. It is a fictitious order which cannot be implemented. The Treaty of Maastricht simply did not provide for mechanisms to enforce its conceptual basis</note>.</bibl>

	<bibl><title level="m">Nor did the successive Stability Pact of 1997 31 complement the Treaty accordingly</title>. <title level="a">The operation of the whole new regime was dependent on good economic luck and constant political bargaining</title>. <title level="a">Against this background, it seems hardly surprising that the Stability Pact was disregarded by such central players as Germany, France and the Netherlands when they felt they had reasons to do so, or that the Commission&apos;s much vaunted efforts to take action against deficits dwindled into nothing 32 . It has, nevertheless, become routine to assign the failure of the EMU to the non-compliance with its rules, and to conclude that such laxity would, in the future, have to be impeded by ever-stricter economic governance. An alternative, more honest and more intriguing interpretation would attribute non-compliance to the economic, social and political costs of the enforcement of a regime which represented an ill-defined political compromise</title>, <note>rather than a sustainable accomplishment of constitutional validity and strength. This is the point to which I will now turn in a somewhat unusual perspective</note>.</bibl>
	<bibl>.2. <title level="a">The Maastricht Compromise as a Diagonal Conflict The oddity of the Maastricht EMU is by now widely recognised. Sergio Fabbrini has characterised it as a &quot;compromise&quot; between German Ordnungspolitik and the majority preference for national sovereignty in the realms of economic and fiscal policy 33 . Kaarlo and Klaus Tuori, in their monograph on the crisis, discern &quot;two layers of the European Economic Constitution&quot; 34 . Whether it be compromise or layer, what Maastricht established was an incoherent edifice. There is nothing unusual or inherently problematical with compromises. What is specific about the Treaty and what distinguishes the European order from constitutional democracies is the lack of a political infrastructure and institutional framework in which democratic political contestation could occur and legitimate a completion or improvement of the unfinished edifice. According to a widely shared -and, in the proceedings before the German Constitutional Court quite intensively considered view -constitutional coherence would have required the move towards political union -a move which Helmut Kohl, then Germany&apos;s chancellor, was ready to undertake, in contrast to other European leaders 35 . Would such a move have saved the EMU? This is what many commentators argue and recommend as a response to the present crisis</title>. <note>Section V will return to this problématique. With regard to the EMU as it was actually established, speculations about what could have been done and what might then have happened do not help us with the characterisation of what we actually ended up with</note>.</bibl>

	<bibl><author>Christian Joerges, Flaws, Old and New</author>, <note>of Economic Governance in Europe 17 My suggestion is that the Treaty of Maastricht institutionalised was de facto a &quot;diagonal&quot; conflict constellation</note>. <title level="a">This notion requires an explanatory remark. Monetary policy has become an exclusive competence of the Union (Article 3(1) c TFEU)</title>. <title level="a">With this provision, the Union claims supremacy in the policy area conferred to it, a conferral which did not include economic and fiscal policies. The exercise of these policies can have external effects and lead to &quot;horizontal&quot; conflicts. As experienced immediately after the establishment of the EMU, monetary policy and the national policies could still come into conflict. This, however, is not a vertical conflict for which supremacy would provide a response. It is a &quot;diagonal conflict&quot;: both the Union and the Member States are certainly interested in the functioning of their economies</title>. <title level="a">But the powers needed to accomplish this objective are attributed to two distinct levels of governance. The type of conflict resolution foreseen in Article 119 TFEU is &quot;the adoption of an economic policy which is based on the close coordination of Member States&apos; economic policies&quot; as substantiated in Article 121 TFEU 36 . As already mentioned, this instrument was legally imperfect. At this point, it is illuminating to consider the insights of the non-legal disciplines cited in the first section. Not only does the diversity of socio-economic conditions even within the Eurozone generate a variety of interests, but the differences in the institutional configurations and economic cultures and in the social norms practiced also explain why European governance could no longer follow common rules</title>. <note>These observations also militate against the complaint about the imperfection of the Stability and Growth Pact of 1997. Its enforcement would have done more damage than the toleration of extra-legal practices</note>.</bibl>

A Common Monetary Policy would mean &quot;ultimately giving up&quot; the opportunity to maintain far-reaching differences between the economic orders 37 . The Community to which Mestmäcker referred looks quite idyllic; it was much smaller and more homogeneous than the current Union, and his expectations and claims may have had a better fundamentum in re under such conditions. But, by know, we know more and can explain a lot. The Union became ever more diverse. The varieties of Europe capitalism persisted and conditioned national policy-making 38 . Taking this ever-36 What kind of power this &quot;co-ordination&quot; mandate confers is thoroughly discussed by B.

Conflict &quot;<note>Resolution&quot; through Authoritarian Managerialism The fragility of the Maastricht arrangement and the erosion of legal ordering were not readily apparent for a long while.

With regard to the compatibility of these measures with the Treaty, in particular, its bailout ban (Article 125 TFEU), an ex-post revision procedure amending Article 136 TFEU has been undertaken in order to legalise financial assistance as of 1 January 2013 41 . A particular intriguing characteristic of Europe&apos;s new modes of economic governance is the form of its crisis management. This &quot;managerialism&quot; is delicate for three inter-dependent reasons. First, through the supervision and control of macro-economic imbalances, it disregards the principle of enumerated powers, and, by the same token, cannot respect the democratic legitimacy of national institutions, in particular, the budgetary powers of the parliaments of the states receiving assistance. Second, in its departure from the one-size-fits-all philosophy that orients European integration in general and monetary policy in particular, it nonetheless fails to achieve a variation, which might be founded in democratically-legitimated choices; quite to the contrary, the individualised scrutiny of all Member States is geared to the objective of budgetary balances and seeks to impose the necessary accompanying discipline. Under the conditions of monetary unity, the Member States can only respond to pertinent requests through austerity measures: reductions of wage levels and of social entitlements 42 .

This implies that rule-of-law and legal protection requirements are being suspended 43 . This type of de-legalisation is accompanied by assessments of Member State performance, which cannot be but highly discretionary 44 . All of this is anathema to legal scholars committed to the legacy of the Freiburg School. It is therefore difficult to understand why Germany&apos;s ordo-liberalism is so widely identified as the ideational background of Europe&apos;s crisis politics, which the German government is orchestrating 45 . All of these measures were taken to compensate for the failure the original EMU and the Pact to prevent a downfall of the financial system of the Eurozone and to provide for rescue measures. This is why Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde, a renowned scholar and former judge of the German Constitutional Court, started to talk of a state of emergency 46 . We will return to this notion below 47 . For now, it should suffice to list the characterisation of the responses to the crisis which seek to capture their exceptionalism or specifics: executive federalism (Habermas) 48 , new sovereignty with largely unfettered power of rule (Chalmers) 49 , consolidating state (Streeck) 50 , authoritarian managerialism (Joerges/Weimer) 51 , legally-and politically-unconstrained expertocracy (Scharpf) 52</title> , <note>executive powers beyond the reach of national and European democracies (Curtin) 53 , and, the transformation of the EU&apos;s democratic deficit into a 43 See the intriguing and concerned analysis by M.

None of these characterisations sounds flattering. Concerns as to their compatibility with Europe&apos;s commitments to democracy and the established understandings of the rule of law are widespread. So are concerns about the erosion of the legitimacy of the integration project as such. Equally disquieting is an emerging consensus about the features which underline the lack of any theoretical/conceptual paradigm. As the most famous (and most thoughtful) proponent of the integration-through-law project summarised it recently: while democracy had neither been on the foundational agenda or credibly accomplished later, an Ersatz-legitimation through the output which the project delivered has become equally fictitious at least for the Member States in Europe&apos;s new periphery. What is left is &quot;messianism</title>&quot;, <note>the release of the peoples of Europe from their bellicose past into a common future which the former aggressor was invited to share 55 .

The critical evaluations listed do not even insinuate a return to the status quo ante and even uncompromising critics of the political choices taken do not suggest that the short decade of Europe&apos;s crisis management can be undone 57 .

It indicates the readiness to take the transformation which we are witnessing as factum (more or less) brutum. The attitude is particularly widespread in legal literature. The new framework is meticulously documented, while queries regarding its legitimacy are treated with benign neglect. A functional equivalent can be found in the re-statement of the position of the Maastricht Court: financial policy is to be treated as a non-political matter which can be delegated to experts.

Making credible this commitment means &apos;doing what has to be done&apos; so that intertwined banking collapses and disorderly sovereign defaults do not trigger the collapse of the Euro Area and place the survival of the wider EU, including the single market, at risk.

	<bibl><title level="a">All of these considerations and conjectures are far from providing a substantiated alternative programmatique</title>. <title level="a">They only assume that Europe&apos;s present post-constitutional constellation is far from stable, and that its precarious legitimacy will provoke political conflict and contestation. To put this slightly differently: legal scholarship is well advised to refrain from presumptuous promises; faced with profound uncertainties, it has to content itself with tentative deliberation. One not-so-tentative assumption is the expectation that the type of normalisation which is currently en vogue will not do away with the conflict configurations which it seeks to control. What lawyers can accomplish is to re-construct the claims raised in these conflicts and evaluate the arguments supporting them. Co-operative problem-solving</title>, <note>rather than authoritarian conditionality, is the constitutional assumption and hope implicit in this diagnosis 62</note> .</bibl>
	<bibl>. &quot;<title level="a">Wo Gefahr ist</title>, <note>wächst das Rettende auch&quot;? 63 An Epilogue Contestation is bound to intensify in Europe</note>, both within national societies and between them. <title level="a">We can hope for productive innovations which such conflicts and debates may generate</title>. <title level="a">But we also have to consider and explore socio-economic conditions, chances of deliberative social and legal change. And we should listen to outside observers who take an intense and emphatic interest in the future of Europe. One particularly stimulating commentator is Dani Rodrik, an economist by education and passionate publicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. In a famous book 64 , Rodrik has submitted his &quot;trilemma thesis</title>&quot;. <title level="a">He asserts the impossibility of the simultaneous pursuit of economic globalisation, democratic politics and national determination (autonomy), highlighting that only two goals can be paired: either economic globalisation and democratic politics, or democracy and national autonomy. Rodrik has recently underlined that the EU furnishes dramatic illustration of this trilemma 65 . The EU could transnationalise democracy through federalisation and thereby defend the advantages of the common market. Federalisation would imply that it would, at the same time, be forced to establish common European politics to legitimise the necessary assumption of fiscal and social policy, with negative consequences for national sovereignty. In the absence of such a de-nationalising will, he asserts, the EU will have to give up the common currency and accept economic disintegration. Is federalisation the way out of the crisis? Rodrik&apos;s diagnosis is de facto deeply pessimistic, because, in his view, the federalisation vision is an abstract utopia. Political Democratic Union would have to be defined and accomplished in democratic processes</title>. <note>The same holds true for the institutional configurations of the economy. All this would have to happen very soon, but is inconceivable in the foreseeable future. He concludes</note>:</bibl>

	<bibl><author>Christian Joerges, Flaws, Old and New</author>, of <title level="m">Economic Governance in Europe 23 &quot;Instead of deepening integration, policy makers must look for ways of undoing it selectively, opening up policy space for national governments in money, finance, and regulation</title>. <title level="a">Under the scenario, the future of monetary union looks particularly bleak, as it is hard to see a single currency can be reconciled with multiple (democratic) polities&quot; 66 . To take outside observers seriously does not mean that we have to subscribe to their argument</title>. <title level="a">In defiance of Dani Rodrik&apos;s Trilemma thesis, I am not persuaded that state-or federation-building is the only conceivable response to the tensions between transnational economic integration and democratic legitimacy</title>. <title level="a">As indicated in the first section, there is a democratic alternative, namely, the &quot;unity in diversity vision&quot; of the 2003 draft constitutional Treaty for European Union. Rodrik would agree, but he would also argue that then we would forego the economic benefits of the common market</title>. <title level="a">But would we really? Werner Abelshauser, in his unitas in pluralitate manifesto, disagrees on empirical and normative grounds</title>. <title level="a">His empirical evidence is the resistance of the varieties of capitalism against economic integration 67 . This phenomenon is anything but deplorable if the institutional diversity is economically beneficial, rather than detrimental 68 . The lawyer is not in a position to reject or to subscribe to the findings of economic historians. What he is competent to explore is the legal framing of the kind of variety that the historian has in mind. To my delight, Abelshauser refers, in note 30 of his manifesto, to the re-conceptualisation of European law as a new type of conflicts law. Conflicts-law constitutionalism is, indeed, a project which conceptualises unity in diversity as Europe&apos;s constitutional form 69 . What I, sadly, have to add is that the crisis has affected this project strongly. It was designed as an exercise in critical theory with normative perspectives which would not confront the state of the integration project with merely normatively attractive ideas, but which, in the tradition of the Frankfurt School, would identify aspects of the integration process which had a potential for institutional innovations, and might, thanks to the ingenuity of committed actors, be transformed in a constructive way. As it seemed in less troubled times, conflicts-law constitutionalism could eventually be elaborated further and proceed as a re-constructive project, i.e., a re-conceptualisation of European law, which would, to a considerable degree, be compatible with European law as it stood, and be able to orient its further development. The re-constructive status was based upon its sociological premises which reflect the conflict-laden European constellation more adequately than the orthodoxy of European law. All that seemed necessary, and, indeed, overdue</title>, <note>was to re-consider the integration project in the light of Europe&apos;s ever growing diversity, to take the conflicts which this diversity generated into account, and to re-orient Europe&apos;s agenda from harmonisation and unity to the management of complex conflict constellations. The analytics of this approach retain their potential, and the normative commitments have</note></bibl>

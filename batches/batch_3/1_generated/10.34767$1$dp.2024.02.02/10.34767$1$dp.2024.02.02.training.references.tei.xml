Using the above methods the following research thesis was formulated</note>: <title level="a">The PFSA as a super-visor of the Polish financial market functions in a complex regulatory envi-ronment in the European Union, which poses a great challenge in achieving the objectives for which it was established. Methodology: The basic research method used in the paper is the dogmat-ic-legal method, the application of which allowed to formulate the research thesis. Moreover, the analysis of the preambles to the acts of the European Union law and the literature on the subject, especially of the representatives of the doctrine of the financial market law, were helpful. Results of the research: The shape of financial supervision architecture is changing as a result of financial market disturbances. The European Union financial market, as a part of the global financial market, is particularly sus-ceptible to such changes. The Polish Financial Supervision Authority is a part of the integrating financial market within the Economic and Monetary Union With Poland's accession to the European Union (EU), the public administration started to function on the basis of the EU legal order. The Polish Financial Su-pervision Authority (PFSA) as a public administration body is a special entity in this area. This uniqueness lies in the specific conditions in which the Polish financial market supervisor must operate. Supervision over the single EU financial market includes EU regulations (treaties, directives and regulations) and normative acts of individual EU mem-ber states. In the case of Poland, these are: Constitution, laws, regulations and the so-called soft law, which has been gaining importance in recent years 1 . In the context of the EU acquis communautaire, each EU country applies EU law on the principle of supremacy over domestic law 2 . The paper contains two parts. The first presents general issues concern-ing the European System of Financial Supervision. The second one presents the PFSA in the supervisory system of the European Union financial market.

This supervision comprises two levels: macropruden-tial and microprudential, creating the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS)</title>. <title level="a">The main objective of the ESFS is to ensure that the rules applicable to the financial sector are adequately implemented to preserve financial stability and to ensure confidence in the financial system as a whole and adequate pro-tection for the consumers of financial services. Macroprudential supervision in the EU is carried out by the European Sys-temic Risk Board (ESRB), established in 2011 3 . Under European law, the ESRB is responsible for the macroprudential oversight of the financial system within the Union in order to contribute to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to financial stability in the Union that arise from events within the financial sys-tem, or mitigation of these risks, taking into account macroeconomic develop-ments, so as to prevent periods of widespread financial distress. The ESRB shall contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market and thereby ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth 4 . Central to the essence of the objective behind the ESRB's activities is the definition of "systemic risk" as amended in 2019. This concept in the revised Union Regu-lation means that it is a risk of disruption in the financial system that has the po-tential to have serious negative consequences for the real economy of the Union or one or more of its Member States, as well as for the functioning of the internal market. All types of financial intermediaries, markets and infrastructure can be potentially systemically important to some extent. 5 At this point in the study, it is worth noting that the ESRB issued a recommendation to the Member States 3 Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 Novem-ber 2010 on European Union macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board</title> (<idno>15.12.2010</idno>), <title level="j">Official Journal of the European Union</title>, <note>L 331/1, and Regulation (EU) 2019/2176 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 on European Union macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (27.12.2019), Official Journal of the European Union, L 334/146</note>.</bibl>

In the case of Poland, the role of a Member State's supervisory authority under the EFSF is played by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA), which exercises supervision over all market segments.

As a result of the emergence of this ESRB document, the Act on macropru-dential supervision over the financial system and crisis management was passed in Poland and implemented in 2015, under which the currently functioning Fi-nancial Stability Committee (FSC), which is also the Polish financial safety net, started its activities. 21 Thus, Article 95 of this Act derogates from the previous Act on the Financial Stability Committee. 22 As the title of the "Macroprudential Act" indicates, its norms regulate the functioning of macroprudential supervision and possible crisis management in the financial system. 23 Such an approach indicates that the entities compris-ing the Financial Stability Committee are active both at the stage of preventing the occurrence of financial crises (crisis prevention) and at the stage of manag-ing disturbances in the Polish financial system (crisis management). Moreover, the above follows directly from Article 3.1 of the "Macroprudential Act</title>", <note>which states that the Committee is the competent authority in the</note> <title level="a">area of macropru-dential supervision and crisis management. The members of the Committee are: Minister of Finance, President of the National Bank of Poland, Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, President of the Management Board of the Bank Guarantee Fund. 24 The tasks of the Committee in the area of macroprudential supervision include 25 : -application of macroprudential instruments, including presentation of po-sitions and issuance of recommendations, -identifying financial institutions posing a significant risk to the financial system, cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board, other Eu-ropean Union authorities</title>, <note>macroprudential supervisory authorities from the Member States or third countries, as well as international institutions, 21 Act of 5 August 2015 on macroprudential supervision of the financial system and crisis mana-gement in the financial system (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1513, as amended</note>).</bibl>

As regards microprudential supervision, as was mentioned earlier, the PFSA cooperates with the European Commis-sion, the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupa-tional Pensions Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European System of Central Banks in the light of Polish regulations and provides them with all information necessary for performing their duties</title>. <note>This cooperation also results from the acts of European law regulating the function-ing of particular supervisory agencies over particular market segments -EBA, ESMA and EIOPA. 26 Article 6 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1513, as amended</note>).</bibl>

	<bibl><note>Conclusion Within the systemic approach to regulation of the European financial market, the essence of which is to increase its security</note>, <title level="a">ensure a high level of protection for its participants and prevent financial crises, the legal framework for the func-tioning of the internal financial market was established. 29 The Polish Financial Supervision Authority is an important element of this multi-level supervisory structure. The Polish financial market supervisory authority is one of the links designed to ensure financial security. Such integrated financial supervision stems from the globalization of financial markets, of which the Polish Financial Super-vision Authority is an inseparable part, and the current shape of the supervisory architecture indicates that the supervisory approach is crucial to ensure financial stability. There are also challenges arising from the fact that not all Member States have centralised supervision along the lines of the the Polish Financial Super-vision Authority. For example -as indicated by Michał Mariański -the separa-tion 2006-2008. Like the then Banking Supervision Commission, the ACPR is closely linked to the central bank, which is intended to contribute to a coordinated yet more specialized supervision of the sector. 30 The special legal regime of the financial market and its separate nature from other market segments means that it is subject to special organization and su-pervision by the state</title>. <note>31 As Anna Jurkowska-Zeidler points out, the systemic approach to the European banking market implies that it is impossible to build a uniform financial market that would be regulated and supervised by all nation-al regulatory and supervisory institutions located in different member states. 32</note></bibl>

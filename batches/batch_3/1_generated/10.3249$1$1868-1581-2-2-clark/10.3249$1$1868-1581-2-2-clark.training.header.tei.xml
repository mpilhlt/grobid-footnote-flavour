	<div type="abstract">II. Structure of Articles 15bis and 15ter -Conditions for<lb/> Exercise of Jurisdiction<lb/> The Special Working Group was less successful in resolving the issue<lb/> of conditions than that of definition. The second sentence of Article 5,<lb/> paragraph 2 of the Statute, added without public debate in the last days of<lb/> the Rome Conference, states that the provision on aggression "shall be<lb/> consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United<lb/> Nations" 33 . By and large, the Permanent Members of the Security Council<lb/> took the position in the negotiations that Article 39 of the Charter confers on<lb/> them the "exclusive" power to make determinations of the existence of an<lb/> act of aggression, and thus a Security Council pre-determination of<lb/> aggression is an essential precondition to exercise of the ICC's jurisdiction.<lb/> Most other States pointed out that Article 24 of the Charter confers<lb/> "primary" power on the Council in respect of the maintenance of<lb/> international peace and justice and that "primary" does not mean 30<lb/></div>

They added that the General Assembly has made several<lb/>Rome Statute, supra note 1, Art. 30, has a general rule that the crimes in the Statute<lb/> must be accompanied by "intent and knowledge". 38<lb/> In the structure of the Statute, a mistake is the obverse of knowledge or intent -it<lb/> negatives a mental element of a crime. Rome Statute Art. 32 says that a mistake of<lb/> fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the<lb/> mental element required by the crime. It continues that a mistake of law as to whether<lb/> a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be<lb/> a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. Finally, it adds that a mistake of law<lb/> may, however, be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the<lb/> mental element required by such a crime, or in certain cases of superior orders. A<lb/> defense that "I made a mistake about the legality of the conduct later held to be<lb/> aggression" might be potentially open to one charged with the crime of aggression.<lb/> The Elements of the crime of aggression work a finesse that is commonly applied to<lb/> Elements of the war crimes under Art. 8 of the Statute by re-directing the enquiry in<lb/> the direction of the facts. The relevant Element is thus: "The perpetrator was aware of<lb/> the factual circumstances that established that such a use of armed force was<lb/> inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.". 39<lb/> Supra notes 25-32. 40<lb/> Draft Art. 15bis (5) of the 2009 Report, supra note 13, provided: "A determination of<lb/> an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the<lb/> Court's own findings under this Statute.".</div>
